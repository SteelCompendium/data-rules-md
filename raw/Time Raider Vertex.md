**Split Space (Action)** ◆ 5 VP

**Effect**: A portal fills the area, leading to a location the vertex has seen (in person or otherwise) on any plane of existence. Each creature who touches the portal is instantly teleported to the nearest unoccupied square at the chosen location. The portal lasts until the vertex dies, uses this ability again, dismisses the portal (no action required), or is transported by the portal.

**Invigorated March (Maneuver)**

**Effect**: Each target can shift half their speed.

**Foresight**
The vertex doesn’t take a bane on attacks against concealed creatures.
