# Stripped Of Rank

You were trained as an officer, but you no longer serve. Did you flee a battle? Were you dishonorably discharged? Did you defect from an evil army?

**Benefit:** You gain the following ability.

## Issue Order

*"Move or die, folks."*

|                                             |             |

| **Keywords:** Ranged **Type:** Action       | **Type:**   |
| **Distance:** Range 10 **Target:** One ally | **Target:** |

**Effect:** The target can use its triggered action to take an

action, a move action, or a maneuver.

**Special:** If you have the Strike Now tactician ability, the target can use a free triggered action instead of a triggered action to use this ability.

**Drawback:** You need 4 Renown, instead of 3, to attract a follower and can gain additional followers for every 4 Renown, instead of 3, you gain after that.
