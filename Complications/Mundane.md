# Mundane

You're hopelessly nonmagical. When you try to use magical abilities, or when they're used on you, they never work right. Even magical devices seem to fizzle in your presence.

**Benefit:** You have corruption, holy, and psychic damage immunity equal to your level.

**Drawback:** While you are carry more than three magic treasures, you have a bane on all power rolls.

You might be a common bandit or an idealistic freedom fighter, but in either case, the local authorities don't approve of your actions. You've managed to stay one step ahead of the law, but until your name is cleared you've got to keep a low profile.

**Benefit:** You gain 1 Renown.

**Drawback:** Law enforcement officials and bounty hunters who recognize you attempt to arrest you.
