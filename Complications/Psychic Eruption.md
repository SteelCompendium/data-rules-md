# Psychic Eruption

In times of stress, you get headaches. Psionic energy builds up in your mind until you feel like your head is going to explode. If you're not careful, it actually does explode, radiating psychic waves that harm friends and enemies alike.

**Benefit:** You gain the following heroic ability:

## Psychic Blast (cost: All Your Heroic Resources) *psionic Energy Bursts From Your Body In An Iridescent Shimmer.*
