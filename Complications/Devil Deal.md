# Devil Deal

Your ancestors made a deal with an archdevil that has tied you to that fiend's service. When you first learned of this deal, you were taken to the Seven Cities of Hell, where some of the timescape's best minds taught you the ways of battle or magic. The archdevil allows you to use these gifts as you will â€¦ until they require a favor from you.

**Benefit**: Whenever you are present for a battle in which all the creatures on one side are not surprised, your side goes first on a result of 4 or greater on the d10 roll (see Determine Who Goes First in Combat Round).

**Drawback**: The archdevil occasionally asks you to defeat enemies on their behalf. If you refuse, your fiendish patron sends [[Devil|devils]] after you and those you care about.
