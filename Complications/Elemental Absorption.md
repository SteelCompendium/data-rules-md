# Elemental Absorption

When an evil mage threatened someone you loved, you blocked your foe's summoning of an elemental creature by absorbing their magic with your body. You are now infused with the power of that elementalâ€”and they're not happy about it.

**Benefit**: Your Stamina increases by 6 at 1st level, then increases by an additional 1 each time you gain a new level.

**Drawback**: When you are dying, your possessing elemental takes control of your body. The elemental yearns for destruction, causing you to attack the closest creature they notice without regard for your desires or your body's safety.
