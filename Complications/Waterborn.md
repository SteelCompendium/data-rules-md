# Waterborn

You nearly lost your life at sea, but then you heard the voice. Someone ... something in the sea called out to you telling you to swim. Suddenly the ocean wasn't your doom. It was your parent, birthing you into something new. You emerge with a small piece of the ocean's power. For what purpose--you can't be sure.

**Benefit:** Your movement gains the Swim tag, and you can breathe underwater. Additionally, you can summon water to do your bidding. You gain the following ability.

## Rogue Wave

*You summon a wave of water to batter your foe.* **Keywords:** Attack, Magic, Ranged

| **Keywords:**           | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

**Power Roll + your highest characteristic:**

- *11 or lower:* 2 **damage; push or pull 1**
- *12-16:* 5 **damage; push or pull 2**
- *17+:* 7 **damage; push or pull 3**

**Effect:** You can forgo dealing damage with this ability.

**Drawback:** You have lightning weakness 5. Additionally, the sea, or one of its representatives, can assign you a

quest. If you don't do the sea's bidding, it may temporarily deny you this complication's benefits--including water breathing--at an inconvenient time.
