# Prone

While you are prone, you are flat on the ground, strikes you make take a bane, and melee abilities made against you gain an edge. You must crawl to move along the ground, which costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. You can't climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If you are climbing, flying, or jumping while you are knocked prone, you fall.

While prone, you can stand up as a maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat), unless the ability or effect that imposed the condition says otherwise. You can use a maneuver to make an adjacent prone creature stand up.
