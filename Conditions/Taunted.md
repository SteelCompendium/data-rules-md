# Taunted

If you are taunted, you have a double bane on attacks that don't include the creature who taunted you. If you gain the taunted condition from one creature while already taunted by a different creature, the new condition replaces the old one.

## Weakened

While you are weakened, all your ability [[Power|power]] rolls and tests (but not resistance rolls) take a bane.
