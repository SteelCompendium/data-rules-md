# Null

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body. You require no weapons, no tools. Any tool can be turned against the hand that wields it. You suffice.

As you strive for perfect order, you become an enemy of that ultimate expression of chaos: Magic. Those who employ sorcery or psionics to break the laws of nature should fear you.

The null is an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs the effects of magic and psionics. You need no weapon because you are the weapon. Your Heroic Resource is discipline. Play a null if you want to resist the supernatural forces of the universe with expert calm and confidence.

## 1st-level Features

As a null, you gain the following features.

### Traditions

Nulls have learned to unlock the full psionic potential of their bodies through extensive physical training. Where a talent has mastery of the mind, the null has mastery of the body.

Choose one of the following traditions. Your choice determines your tradition features and tradition triggered action in addition to several features you get at later levels.

- **Chronokinetic:** Your training has allowed you to become unmoored from time, using the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain a lore skill.
- **Cryokinetic:** You are able to tap into the most essential energy of the manifolds, absolute cold, and manifest those effects in your body. You gain a crafting skill.
- **Metakinetic:** Many attempt to perfect their bodies, but you have learned to see through the illusions of the universe to understand your true body and its true psionic potential. You gain an exploration skill.

### Discipline

Mastery of your body and tradition in its use fuel your powers. You have a heroic resource called discipline.

#### Discipline In Combat

When a combat encounter begins, you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of your turn in combat, you gain 2 discipline. You gain 1 discipline the first time in a round your null field affects a creature. When combat ends, your discipline drops to 0.

#### Discipline Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs discipline outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline on it equal to your Victories.

### Null Field

You have the ability to project a psionic field of order around your body. This field dampens the effects of supernatural abilities that attempt to harm you and any allies within.

#### Null Field

> Magic is a form of chaos. My body is beyond such things

|                       |                    |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** Psionic | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self    | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** Until you are dying, attacks with the Magic or Psionic keyword take a bane if they target a target within the aura or are made by an enemy within the aura. Resistance rolls against abilities with the Magic or Psionic keyword have an edge if they target a target within the aura or are used by an enemy within the aura. These effects increase to a double bane or a double edge, respectively, if the creature using the ability is grabbed by you.

### Inertial Shield

Your body has been trained to predict when attacks will happen before they happen.

#### Inertial Shield

> You intuit where an incoming attack will strike, reducing its effects.

**Trigger:** You take damage.

**Effect:** You gain `ðŸ›¡` for the attack and reduce any potency of effects associated with the damage by 1.
