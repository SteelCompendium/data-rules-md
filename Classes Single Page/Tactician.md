# Tactician

Strategist. Defender. Leader. With sword in hand, you lead allies into the maw of battle, barking out commands that inspire your fellow heroes to move faster and strike more precisely. All the while, you stand between your compatriots and death, taunting the followers of evil to best you if they can.

As a tactician, you have abilities that heal your allies and grant them extra damage, movement, and attacks. You can taunt your enemies into attacking you instead of targeting your allies, and can help soak up damage when those allies stand alone.

## Basics

**Weak Potency:** Reason score - 1\
**Average Potency:** Reason score\
**Strong Potency:** Reason score + 1

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21\

## 1st-level Features

As a tactician, you gain the following features:

### Tactical Doctrine

Warfare is as old as civilizationâand perhaps even older. As battle became ever more developed and complex, military leaders invented doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield.

You have developed a mastery of tactics of historical significance, letting you choose one of the following doctrines:

- **Vanguard (Shock and Awe):** You have learned the tactics and stratagems of the heroes of ancient history, letting you lead from the front lines of battle and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.
- **Mastermind (Grand Strategy):** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board, and seeking victory by thinking multiple steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
- **Insurgent (Asymmetric Warfare):** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. By contrast, you'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.

Your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Focus

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

#### Focus In Combat

When a combat encounter begins, you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of your turn in combat, you gain 2 focus. The first time in a round an ally attacks a target you have marked, you gain 1 focus. When combat ends, your focus drops to 0.

#### Focus Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs focus outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus on it equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level Tactical Doctrine Features

| Doctrine   | Feature             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Vanguard   | Commanding Presence |
| Mastermind | Studied Commander   |
| Insurgent  | Covert Operations   |

#### Commanding Presence

You command any room you walk into. While you are present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations and influencing tests. Additionally, each hero with you has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation with the other side.

#### Covert Operations

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests with any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist on any test made with a skill from the intrigue skill group. At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of negotiation.

#### Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper, with projects seeking common lore becoming free, but still requiring a respite activity to complete. (See Research and Crafting in future packets for more information.)

Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter, you can make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following test results apply:

- **Combat Encounter:**
    - 11 or lower: The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
    - 12-16: The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
    - 17+: As 12-16, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.
- **Negotiation:**
    - 11 or lower: The Director tells you three different motivations, one of which is one of the NPC's motivations, and the other two are not.
    - 12-16: The Director tells you one of the NPC's motivations.
    - 17+: As 12-16, and you and your allies gain an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can only make this test once for each encounter and negotiation.

### Doctrine Triggered Action

Your doctrine grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Tactician Triggered Actions table.

| Doctrine   | Triggered Action |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Vanguard   | Parry            |
| Mastermind | Overwatch        |
| Insurgent  | Advanced Tactics |

#### Advanced Tactics

Your leadership thwarts an enemy or aids an ally.

|                    |                    |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** â                    | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self   |

- **Trigger:** The target makes an attack against another creature.

**Effect:** Add or subtract (SURGE) to the attack.

**Spend 3 Focus:** Increase or decrease the potency of one effect from the attack.

#### Parry

Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.

- **Trigger:** A creature makes a Weapon attack against the target.

**Effect:** The attack's damage is reduced (SHIELD)(SHIELD).

**Spend 3 Focus:** Decrease the potency of all effects on the attack by 1.

#### Overwatch

Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.

- **Trigger:** The target moves.

**Effect:** At any point during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against the target.

**Spend 1 Focus:** The target is also R \[average\] slowed.

### Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an additional martial kit and gain the benefits of both kits. (See Kits.)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities of both kits.

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

- **Stamina Bonus:** +12
- **Stability Bonus:** +1
- **Melee Weapon Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2
- **Speed Bonus:** +1
- **Ranged Weapon Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+3
- **Distance Bonus:** +10
- **Disengage:** +1
- You also gain the use of the Protective Attack and Patient Shot signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses applied. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+3. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit would reduce its damage by -2/-2/-2, as it loses the bonus from the Martial Artist kit. It then gains the +0/+0/+3 of the Mountain kit, to deal damage of 2/5/10 for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results.

### Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability:

#### Mark

You draw your allies' attention to a specific foeâwith devastating effect.

**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the start of your next turn. When attacking a marked target, you and each of your allies gain a damage surge (SURGE).

**Spend 1 Focus or More Focus:** You focus on understanding the tactics of your foe, countering their strengths and exploiting their weaknesses to enhance your squad.

Each focus is banked on the marked creature, increasing the effectiveness of your mark, as indicated on your doctrine's focused mark table below. A marked creature with focus on it stays marked until the end of the encounter. When the marked creature is reduced to 0 Stamina or otherwise removes the mark, you regain the focus.

You can use this maneuver on an already marked creature to bank more focus.
