## 1st-level Features

As a tactician, you gain the following features.

## Tactical Doctrine

Warfare is as old as civilization--and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more developed and complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of tactics of historical significance, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Vanguard):

**Insurgent (Asymmetric Warfare):** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. By contrast, you'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.

- **Mastermind (Grand Strategy):** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board, and seeking victory by thinking multiple steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
- **Vanguard (Shock and Awe):** You have learned the tactics and stratagems of the heroes of ancient history, letting you lead from the front lines of battle and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.

Your choice of tactical doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

## Focus

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

#### Focus In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus. Additionally, the first time each round that you or an ally damages a target you have marked, you gain 1 focus. The first time in a round that an ally within 10 squares of you uses a heroic ability, you gain 1 focus. You lose any remaining focus at the end of the encounter.

#### Focus Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs focus, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited focus on its effect, such as Mark, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus on it equal to your Victories.

## 1st-level Doctrine Feature

Your chosen tactical doctrine grants you a feature as shown on the 1st-Level Doctrine Features table.

#### **1st-level Doctrine Features**

| Doctrine   | Feature             |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Covert Operations   |
| Mastermind | Studied Commander   |
| Vanguard   | Commanding Presence |

### Commanding Presence

You command any room you walk into. While you are present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations. Additionally, each hero with you has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation with the other side.

#### Covert Operations

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests with any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist on any test made with a skill from the intrigue group. At the Director's discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of negotiation.

#### Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Downtime Projects for more information.)

Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following test results apply to a combat encounter:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.

The following test results apply to a negotiation:

- *11 or lower:* The Director tells you three different motivations, one of which is one of an NPC's motivations, while the other two are not.
- *12-16:* The Director tells you one of an NPC's motivations.
- *17+:* As 12-16, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation.

## Doctrine Triggered Action

Your tactical doctrine grants you a triggered action as shown on the Doctrine Triggered Actions table.

#### **doctrine Triggered Actions**

| Doctrine   | Triggered Action |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Insurgent  | Advanced Tactics |
| Mastermind | Overwatch        |
| Vanguard   | Parry            |

#### Advanced Tactics

*Your leadership aids an ally.*

| Keywords: Ranged    | Type: Triggered      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Distance: Ranged 10 | Target: Any creature |

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to another creature.

**Effect:** The target gains two surges, which they can use on the triggering damage.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If any effect of the damage has a potency effect, you increase the potency by 1.

#### Overwatch

*Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.*

| Keywords: Ranged           | Type: Triggered   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Distance: Ranged 10        | Target: One enemy |
| Trigger: The target moves. |                   |

**Effect:** At any point during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against them.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If the target has R **\<** average, they are also slowed (EoT).

#### Parry

*Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.*

| Keywords: Melee, Weapon                         | Type: Triggered          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Distance: Melee 1                               | Target: Self or one ally |
| Trigger: A creature deals damage to the target. |                          |

**Effect:** The damage is halved. If any effect of the damage has a potency effect, you decrease the potency by 1.

**Spend 1 Focus:** The target can shift a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

## Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an additional kit and gain the benefits of both kits, including both their

signature abilities. See Kits for more information. (*Quick Build:* Shining Armor, Sniper)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities of both kits.

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

- **Stamina Bonus:** +12
- **Stability Bonus:** +1
- **Melee Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2
- **Ranged Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+4
- **Speed Bonus:** +1
- **Ranged Distance Bonus:** +10
- **Disengage Bonus:** +1
- You can use the Protective Attack and Patient Shot signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses applied. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results to 3/6/9. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the Mountain kit, to deal 3/6/13 damage.

### Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability.

#### Mark

*You draw your allies' attention to a specific foe--with devastating effect.*

|                                                                                           |                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged **Type:** Maneuver **Distance:** Ranged 10 **Target:** 1 ally | **Type:** Action                   |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 **Target:** 1 enemy or object                                     | **Target:** One creature or object |

**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the end of the encounter, you die, you use this ability again, or you willingly end this effect (no action required). If another tactician marks the target, then your mark on the target ends. You can have one target marked this way, but other tactician abilities can allow you to have multiple marked creatures.

While the target is marked and within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect have an edge on power rolls made against the target.

When the marked creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to move the mark to a new target within 10 squares.

In addition, you can spend 1 focus to take one of the following free triggered actions whenever you or an ally damages a target with an ability. You can't use more than one instance of a benefit per trigger:

- The ability deals additional damage equal to twice your Reason score.

- The damage dealer can spend a Recovery.

- The damage dealer can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. ## STRIKE NOW

Your skill at commanding your allies in combat grants you the following ability.

"STRIKE NOW!"

*Your foe left an opening. You point this out to an ally!*

**Effect:** The target can make a signature attack as a free triggered action.

**Spend 5 Focus:** You target two allies instead of one.

## Tactician Abilities

You are a formidable combatant in your own right, but your greatest strength in battle is the ability to make your allies even more formidable. You know a range of abilities that shape the scope of your control of the battlefield.

#### Kit Signature Ability

Your additional kit from your Field Arsenal feature grants you a second signature ability. Signature abilities can be used at will.

#### Heroic Abilities

Your heroic abilities cover a range of combat tactics, all of which require focus to use.

*On your command, you and your allies force back the enemy line.*

**Effect:** Each target can move their speed.

5-FOCUS ABILITY

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 5 focus to use. (*Quick Build:* Hammer and Anvil)

#### Hammer And Anvil (5 Focus)

*"Let's not argue about who's the hammer and who's the anvil!"*

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **5 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can make a signature strike against the target as a free triggered action**
- *12-16:* 9 + M **damage; one ally within 10 squares can make a signature strike that gains an edge against the target as a free triggered action**
- *17+:* 12 + M **damage; two allies within 10 squares can each make a signature strike that gains an edge against the target as free triggered actions**

**Effect:** If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina and a strike granted by this ability hasn't been made, the striker can pick a different target.

### 2nd-level Doctrine Feature

| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Insurgent  | Infiltration Tactics |
| Mastermind | Goaded               |
| Vanguard   | Melee Superiority    |

#### Goaded

You have learned to leverage the psychology of your marked foes and goad them into acting before they are tactically ready. When a creature marked by you uses a strike that targets you or an ally, you can use a free triggered action to retarget the attack to you or another one of your allies or yourself. The new target must be a valid option for the strike.

After constant drills you have improved your ability to anticipate an enemy's attack and thwart their attempts to move freely across the battlefield. Whenever you make an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

**Mark Benefit:** You can spend 2 focus to make a melee free strike against a marked creature who attempts to move or Disengage within distance of your melee free strike as a free triggered action. If you do, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

TRY ME INSTEAD (5 FOCUS)

Choose one of the following abilities.

NO DYING ON MY WATCH (5 FOCUS)

*You prioritize saving an ally over your own safety.*

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to an ally.

**Effect:** You move up to your speed toward the target, ending your move in the nearest square adjacent to them if you can. The triggering ally can spend a Recovery, and gains 5 Temporary Stamina for each enemy you move past while moving to the target. You then make a power roll against the target.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* R \< weak\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*
- *12-16:* R \< average\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*

## 3rd-level Features

## Out Of Position

You are prepared for all eventualities.

The target can't be moved in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.

## 7-focus Ability

#### Rout (7 Focus)

## Talent

The talent is a master of psionics--a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind. In rare occurrences, people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent's abilities, can actually tap into the mind's full strength.

A talent is limited only by the strength of their mind. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But with this limitless potential comes a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent, and those who use too many too quickly die from the exertion.

## Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Reason of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:

- 2, -1, -1

## 1st-level Features

As a talent, you gain the following features.

## Talent Tradition

Psionic abilities are grouped into specific categories according to their power and effects. Each category comprises one of many talent traditions, including the following:

**Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things

- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air of the environment around you
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it

**Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects

- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures As a talent gains mastery over their mind, they are drawn to a tradition that can be manifested as easily as breathing. Choose one of the following talent traditions: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. (*Quick Build:* telekinesis) Your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain from this class. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future products.)

## Clarity And Strain

The focus and precision of your thoughts grants you a Heroic Resource called clarity that empowers your psionic abilities.

#### Clarity In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 clarity. You gain 1 clarity the first time each round that a creature is force moved.

You can spend clarity you do not have, pushing that Heroic Resource into negative numbers, to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each negative point of clarity.

Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of the encounter.

#### Clarity Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

Additionally, if you use two or more abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using those abilities or effects.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.

## Mind Spike

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

#### Mind Spike

*A telepathic bolt instantly zaps a creature's brain.*

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 + R psychic damage**
- *12-16:* **4 + R psychic damage**
- *17+:* **6 + R psychic damage**

**Strained:** The strike deals an extra 2 psychic damage to the target and to you. The damage you take can't be reduced in any way.

## Telepathic Speech

You know the Mindspeech language (see Languages). Additionally, you can telepathically communicate with any creatures within the distance of your Mind Spike ability if they share a language with you and you know of each

other. The receiver of your telepathic communications can choose to respond telepathically.

## 1st-level Features

As a troubadour, you gain the following features.

## Troubadour Class Act

Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone starts somewhere. Your class act is your art form, summing up the manner in which the world becomes your stage. As you go about unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife, you choose a troubadour class act from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* Virtuoso):

- **Duelist:** Drama embraces your every movement done in tandem with another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to return your passion in kind. You gain the Gymnastics skill.
- **Skald:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You gain the Brag skill.
- **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between the vibrations of your sound and filling the audience with your pathos. You gain the Music skill and you wield an instrument.

Your choice of class act determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

## Drama

During battles, you are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and upside downs of the fray, from which you derive a Heroic Resource called drama.

#### Drama In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

Additionally, you gain drama when certain events occur during battle:

- **2 Drama:** Three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn for the first time.
- **2 Drama:** A hero becomes winded for the first time (only once per encounter and not once per hero).
- **3 Drama:** A creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20.
- **10 Drama:** A hero, including you, dies.

You still gain drama during combat if you are dead as long as your body is intact. During the encounter in which you died, if you have 30 drama, you can come back to life with

1 Stamina and 0 drama (no action required). You can't gain drama in future encounters while you remain dead.

You lose any remaining drama at the end of the encounter.

#### Drama Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama on it equal to your Victories.

### Scene Partner

Whenever you use a skill from the interpersonal group on a test while interacting with an NPC (a bystander, a rival, and so forth) and you don't fail the test, you can form a bond with that NPC. If you then enter into a negotiation with this NPC, their patience increases by 1, and any compelling arguments you personally make to the NPC that would increase their interest by 1 instead increase their interest by 2. You can have a number of such bonds active equal to your level, losing a bond of your choice whenever you make a new bond beyond your limit.

## Curtain Call

You enter every performance with a set of routines at the ready. Routines are auras and other wide-reaching effects that have the Routine keyword, and which center around you while you move through the fray. At the start of each round of combat, as long as you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either set a new routine to be active or maintain your current routine (no action required). Your routine ends if you are unable to maintain it, or at the end of the encounter.

You start off with the Choreography and Revitalizing Limerick routine ability. Your choice of troubadour class act then grants you additional routines.

CHOREOGRAPHY

*Taps, kicks, steps. Now it's all "choreography."*

**Effect:** While this routine is active, each target who starts their turn in the aura gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of their turn.

#### Revitalizing Limerick

**Effect:** While this routine is active, choose a number of targets equal to your Presence score at the end of your turn. Each chosen target can spend a Recovery.

Whenever you roll to gain 1d3 drama at the start of your turn, you can make your appeal to gain the following additional effects:

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama. The Director also gains 1d3 Malice.

Whenever you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use your action to introduce yourself and your allies to your opponents. Each creature on your side can shift up to their speed and gains the benefit of the Defend action (see Actions) until the end of the round. However, any enemies who were surprised are no longer surprised.

#### Formal Introductions

As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival, such as a calling card or a formal letter, addressed to an enemy and have it delivered. You can deliver the notice to the target personally if you are in the same general area, send it by courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can have only one notice active at a time.

The Director determines when the target receives your notice. Once the target receives the notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per round during future encounters involving the target. The heroes start each such encounter with 2 additional hero tokens. These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.

You can invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with a group of creatures who haven't met you before, automatically creating a bond with a representative NPC as if using your Scene Partner feature (see above).

The Director can choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond, making you infamous with the community instead. Until actions are taken to improve your reputations, all present heroes take a bane on tests using skills from the interpersonal skill group with the group of creatures. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the community.

Additionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to invoke an invisible roar of an applauding audience. You and all allies within 3 gain temporary Stamina equal to 10 + your number of active bonds (see Scene Partner) + either your Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher).
