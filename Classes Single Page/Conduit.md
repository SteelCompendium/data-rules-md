# Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting you increased empathy.

- 2, 2, -1, -1
- 2, 1, 1, -1
- 2, 1, 0, 0
- 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Intuition score - 1

## 1st-level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

### Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Conduit Deities table, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

> *Playtest note: More gods and saints are coming, along with their descriptions.*

#### Conduit Deities

| Deity   | Domains                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Adun    | Love, Protection, Storm, War    |
| Cavall  | Knowledge, Protection, Sun, War |
| Cyrvis  | Fate, Death, Nature, Trickery   |
| Malus   | Creation, Fate, Life, Knowledge |
| Salorna | Death, Nature, Storm, Sun       |
| Viras   | Creation, Life, Love, Trickery  |

### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety to fuel your abilities. You use piety to heal and empower your allies, and to unleash your deity's power upon your foes.

#### Piety In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods when you roll to gain piety, but beware. Praying to the gods can easily draw their ire! They hate to be annoyed. When you roll to gain piety, you can pray to the gods and gain the additional effects (no action required):

- If your piety roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take 1d6 + your level psychic damage, which can't be reduced in any way.
- If your piety roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
- If your piety roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and you can activate a domain effect of your choice.

Your piety disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### Piety Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs piety outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, out of combat, you can use it…

it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.

#### Domain Effects

Whenever you get a domain effect by praying for piety, you can choose one of your domain's effects to immediately take effect.

##### Creation Domain Effect

You create a **5 + Intuition score** wall of stone within **10 squares** of you.

##### Death Domain Effect

Two enemies of your choice within **10 squares** of you take **2d6** magic corruption damage.

Choose another creature you have line of effect to. That creature automatically gets a **tier 1** or **tier 3** result ( your choice) on their next power roll.

##### Knowledge Domain Effect

Choose up to **three allies** within **10 squares** of you. Each ally has an **edge** on the next ability they use before the end of their next turn.

##### Life Domain Effect

You or an ally within **10 squares** of you can spend **2 Recoveries**, end any effects on them that have a duration of **EoT** or are ended by a saving throw, and can stand up if they are prone. Alternatively, you and an ally within **10 squares** of you gain temporary Stamina equal to **5 × your Intuition score**.

##### Love Domain Effect

Each ally within **10 squares** of you gains temporary Stamina equal to **2 × your Intuition score**.

##### Nature Domain Effect

Vines whip up from the floor or ground around a number of creatures of your choice within **10 squares** of you equal to your Intuition score. You can slide each creature up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score.

##### Protection Domain Effect

An ally of your choice within **10 squares** of you gains **resistance to all damage**, which lasts until the end of your next turn.

##### Storm Domain Effect

Each enemy in a **3-cube area** within **10 squares** of you takes **2d6** magic lightning damage.

##### Sun Domain Effect

An enemy of your choice within **10 squares** of you takes **3d6** magic fire damage.

##### Trickery Domain Effect

Choose a creature within **10 squares** of you. You can slide that creature a number of squares equal to **5 + your conduit level**. If you choose a willing ally, this movement can ignore their stability.

##### War Domain Effect

Your abilities gain **additional damage** until the end of your turn.

While you are within **10 squares** of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their form could sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings.

As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the target's soul, granting a **+1 bonus on saving throws**. This benefit lasts until you complete another respite.

#### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn **1 or more Victories**, you earn an equal number of **Fate points**. When you or a creature within **10 squares** of you makes a test, you can spend **1 Fate point** to allow your god to share a vision of the outcome of the test with the creature making it, allowing them to adjust their plan for better success. The creature gets an **edge** on the test. You lose all your Fate points when you finish a respite.

#### Protective Circle

You can spend **10 minutes** working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on the ground around a **size 1 area** of land.

You can beseech the gods to restore a fallen ally to life. To do so, you must have at least half of the creature's remains and they must have died an untimely death from something that isn't age-related within the last **24 hours**.

As a respite activity, you perform a religious ritual to return the creature to life.
