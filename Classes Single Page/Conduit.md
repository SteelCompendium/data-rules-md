# Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting you increased empathy.

## 1st-level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

### Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Gods and Religion chapter, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

(*Quick Build:* Adun for deity, Life and Protection for domains)

### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety, letting you heal and empower your allies, and unleash holy power upon your foes.

### Piety In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods--but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. When you roll to gain 1d3 piety at the start of your turn, you can pray to gain the following additional effects (no action required):

- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.
- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).

You lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter.

### Piety Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs piety, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, you can

use it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.

#### Domain Piety And Effects

Your choice of domains provides you with extra ways that you can earn piety during combat. These ways of gaining piety are triggered by events that happen during combat. There is a chance that you could have a single event trigger both of your piety effects. For example, if you are a 1st-level conduit and have the Sun domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes fire damage, and the War domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes 11 or more damage, and a nearby creature takes 12 fire damage, you would gain piety from both domains for that one effect.

Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, choose one of your domains. That domain's effect takes effect immediately.

#### Creation Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you uses an ability with the Area keyword.

**Prayer Effect:** You summon the forces of creation and create a wall of stone whose size is 5 + your Intuition score within 10 squares of you. The wall lasts until the end of the encounter.

#### Death Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you who isn't a minion dies or a solo creature becomes winded.

**Prayer Effect:** You inflict a deadly curse upon two enemies of your choice within 10 squares of you. Each target takes corruption damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

#### Fate Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an ally within 10 squares of you gets a tier 3 result or an enemy within 10 squares of you gets a tier 1 result.

**Prayer Effect:** You call on the forces of fate to create a reliable future. Choose a creature within your line of effect. That creature automatically gets a tier 1 or tier 3 result (your choice) on their next power roll made before the end of the encounter.

#### Knowledge Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that the Director uses an ability or feature that costs Malice.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose up to three allies, including yourself, within 10 squares of you. Each target gains a surge.

#### Life Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that a creature within 10 squares of you regains Stamina.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose yourself or one ally within 10 squares of you. The targets can spend a Recovery, can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn, or can stand up if they are prone. Alternatively, you and one ally within 10 squares of you gain temporary Stamina equal to 5 x your Intuition score.

#### Love Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or an ally within 10 squares of you uses the Aid Another maneuver or an ability that targets an ally.

**Prayer Effect:** Each ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 2 x your Intuition score.

#### Nature Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage.

**Prayer Effect:** Vines whip up from the floor or ground within 10 squares of you, wrapping around a number of creatures of your choice equal to your Intuition score. You can slide each creature up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score. The vines then fade away.

#### Protection Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or an ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina or uses a triggered action to reduce incoming damage or give an enemy a bane on a power roll.

**Prayer Effect:** One ally within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to three times your Intuition score.

#### Storm Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an enemy within 10 squares of you is force moved.

**Prayer Effect:** Each enemy in a 3-cube area within 10 squares of you takes lightning damage equal to twice your Intuition score.

#### Sun Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that an enemy within 10 squares of you takes fire or holy damage.

**Prayer Effect:** One enemy of your choice within 10 squares of you takes fire damage equal to three times your Intuition score.

#### Trickery Domain Piety And Effect

**Piety:** You gain 2 piety the first time in an encounter that you or a creature within 10 squares of you takes the Aid Another or Hide maneuver.

**Prayer Effect:** Choose a creature within 10 squares of you. You can slide that creature up to a number of squares equal to 5 + your conduit level.

#### Blessing Of Fortunate Weather

When you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares of you.

Until you finish another respite, the weather conditions you establish follow you through any mundane outdoor locations.

physically interact with the world, but they have a speed of 5 and can fly. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their type would sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings.

#### Grave Speech

You gain the following ability.

GRAVE SPEECH

*You commune with the lingering soul of the recently dead.*

|                                                                                                                |                                    |

**Effect:** You can speak to the target corpse (including just the head) of a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you.

You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

#### Hands Of The Maker

You gain the following ability.

HANDS OF THE MAKER

*You can craft objects with the power of your mind!*

#### Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the chosen character's soul, granting them a +1 bonus on saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.

#### Inspired Deception

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Intuition on the test instead of another characteristic.

#### Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. When you or a creature within 10 squares of you makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.

#### Protective Circle

You can spend 10 minutes working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold a size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective area, a creature can't be targeted by strikes.

#### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or an ally who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. When you perform the ritual, the chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level, which lasts until you finish another respite.

*Hey! I'm over here. No, here, numbskull.* **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged **Type:** Maneuver

**Effect:** You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere within distance. These duplicates last until the end of the encounter. On each of their turns, the target can move the duplicates up to their speed. When one of the duplicates takes damage, the duplicate is destroyed. If the target is targeted with an ability, they can use a free triggered action to switch place with a duplicate in line of effect. The ability targets the duplicate instead.

#### Word Of Death Deferred

You can stop death from taking your allies. When an ally within your Healing Grace distance dies and you are not dying, you can use a free triggered action to instead have them fall unconscious until they regain Stamina.

Additionally, your abilities deal an additional 5 damage to winded creatures.

#### Word Of Fate Denied

When an ally within 10 squares of you takes damage that would make them start dying, you can transfer the harm to yourself or another willing creature within 10 squares of you as a free triggered action. The creature you choose takes the damage instead and suffers any effect associated with it, and that damage can't be reduced in any way.

#### Your Triumphs Are Remembered

The gods allow you and your companions to bask in the glory of past successes. When you end a respite, you and any other heroes ending the respite with you have 1 Victory instead of 0. This Victory can't be converted into XP.

## Faithful's Reward

When you roll for piety at the start of your turn, you gain 1d3 + 1 piety.

## 10th-level Features

As a 10th-level conduit, you gain the following features.

### Avatar

You are now an avatar of your god! When you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity 3 questions, which the Director must answer honestly (though they may answer cryptically and not completely) if your deity knows the answer to the questions. Additionally, you can emerge from your respite in any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.

Additionally, you can be affected by up to three prayers at once. You can change all of these prayers and your ward as a respite activity.

You can also use a maneuver to activate one of your domain effects without needing to pray.

### Characteristic Increase

Your Intuition score becomes 5. Additionally, you can increase one of your characteristic scores by 1, to a maximum score of 5.

### Divine Power

You gain an epic resource called divine power. When you take a respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend divine power as if it were piety on abilities you have.

Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any conduit abilities you don't have, since the gods

can answer your prayers with temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have that normally costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.

Divine power remains until you spend it.

## Most Pious

When you roll for piety at the start of your turn and pray, you gain 1 additional piety.

## Perk

You gain a crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

You gain one skill of your choice.

## Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mystery. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, put an enemy exactly where you want them, debilitate foes with harmful effects, ward yourself and allies against danger, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your choice of elemental specialization determines which of these things you do best.

## 1st-level Features

As an elementalist, you gain the following features.

## Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape.

**Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.

- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster your hardiness.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies. Rot is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff
- enemies.

**Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create

- illusions, and make things incorporeal. **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse. Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (*Quick Build:* fire) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain from this class, including one of the benefits below. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.)

#### Earth: Acolyte Of Earth

You gain this feature if earth is your specialization, letting you harness the flow of earth magic to become harder to move. Whenever you use an earth magic ability, your stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn. This benefit is cumulative.

#### Fire: Acolyte Of Fire

You gain this feature if fire is your specialization, becoming an expert at wielding destructive flames. Your abilities that have the Fire and Magic keywords gain a +1 rolled damage bonus.

#### Green: Acolyte Of The Green

You gain this feature if green is your specialization, harnessing the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. Whenever you deal damage to one or more creatures with a green magic ability that costs essence to use (see below), you or one creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score.

#### Void: Acolyte Of The Mystery

You gain this feature if void is your specialization, using your immersion in the mystery of void magic to hold onto that magic longer than other mages. The distance of all your ranged void magic abilities increases by 2.

## Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

#### Essence In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. You also gain 1 essence the first time in a round that you or a creature within 10 of you takes damage that isn't untyped or holy.

You lose any remaining essence at the end of the encounter.

### Essence Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs essence, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a respite.

If you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence on it equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the elementalist but might appear in future products.)

## Hurl Element

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

#### Hurl Element

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at an unsuspecting foe.*

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 + R damage**
- *12-16:* **4 + R damage**
- *17+:* **6 + R damage**

**Effect:** When you make this strike, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

## Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry. For example, the Instantaneous Excavation ability has an effect noted as "Persistent 1." Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain

it, and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end at the end of the encounter.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to or greater than 5 x your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For instance, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining Instantaneous Excavation, taking 10 or more damage in one turn causes you to stop maintaining the ability.

## Practical Magic

You have the following ability:

#### Practical Magic

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

| Keywords: Magic, Ranged   | Type: Maneuver |
| ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Distance: Self; see below | Target: Self   |

- **Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:
- You use the Knockback maneuver, but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and deal damage equal to your Reason score to them. The damage type can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.
- You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

## 1st-level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 1st-Level Elemental Specialization Features table.

#### **1st-level Elemental Specialization Features**

| Specialization | Feature                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earth          | Motivate Earth             |
| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |
| Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

#### A Beyonding Of Vision

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. You always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and you know the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability.

SHARED VOID SENSE

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

| Keywords: Magic, Ranged, Void | Type: Maneuver  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Distance: Ranged 10           | Target: Special |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. That creature gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of Shared Void Sense.

#### It Is The Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand Animals, Monstrosities, and Plant Creatures, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with such creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason in place of Presence while making tests to influence them.

Additionally, whenever you touch a living plant that is not a Plant Creature, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

#### Motivate Earth

You gain the following ability.

MOTIVATE EARTH

| The earth rises, falls, or opens up at your command. |                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Keywords: Earth, Magic, Melee                        | Type: Action    |
| Distance: Melee 1                                    | Target: Special |

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that takes up at least 2 squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it.

You can instead touch a doorway or other opening in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface that is no larger than 1 square. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

#### Return To Formlessness

You gain the following ability.

RETURN TO FORMLESSNESS

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to combust and melt, destroying it. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object that you touch is destroyed.

## Specialization Triggered Action

Your elemental specialization grants you a triggered action as shown on the Specialization Triggered Actions table.

#### **specialization Triggered Actions**

| Specialization | Triggered Action              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Earth          | Skin Like Castle Walls        |
| Fire           | Explosive Assistance          |
| Green          | The Breath of Dawn Remembered |
| Void           | A Subtle Relocation           |

THE BREATH OF DAWN REMEMBERED

*The power you channel grants the ability to get back in the fight.*

**Effect:** The target can spend a Recovery.

**Spend Essence:** The target can spend an additional Recovery for each essence spent.

EXPLOSIVE ASSISTANCE

*You add a little magic to an ally's aggression at just the right time.*

**Effect:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to your Reason score.

**Spend 1 Essence:** The forced movement distance gains a bonus equal to twice your Reason score instead.

SKIN LIKE CASTLE WALLS

*You make yourself or an ally covered in protective stone.*

**Effect:** The damage is halved.

**Spend 1 Essence:** If the damage has any potency effect associate with it, the potency is reduced by 1.

A SUBTLE RELOCATION

*You call on the void to swallow and spit out an ally.*

**Effect:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If the target moves to trigger this ability, you can teleport them at any point during the move.

**Spend 1 Essence:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Reason score instead.

### Enchantment

You weave an elemental enchantment into your body that enhances your statistics. You can change your enchantment along with your ward (see Elementalist Ward) by performing a complex ritual as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Enchantment of Destruction)

### Enchantment Of Battle

You tap into the elemental mysteries to gain the mind and training of a warrior. You can wear light armor and wield

#### Enchantment Of Celerity

## 2nd-level Features

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Perk

You gain a crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

### 2nd-level Specialization Feature

Your elemental specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 2nd-Level Specialization Features table.

#### **2nd-level Specialization Features**

| Specialization | Feature                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Earth          | Disciple of Earth         |
| Fire           | Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green     |
| Void           | There is No Space Between |

#### Disciple Of The Green

You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a type of creature on the Green Animal Forms table. While in animal form, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Your statistics stay the same except as noted on the table.

Each form has a prerequisite level that you must attain in this class before you can adopt it. Some animal forms grant you temporary Stamina. You lose this temporary Stamina when you revert back to your true form.

You choose a specific animal and appearance while in animal form. For example, if you become a rodent, you might become a mouse, a rat, a shrew, or any other size 1T rodent who fits the animal type. When you take on animal form, your equipment either melds into your new form or falls unharmed to the ground, as you decide. When you return to your true form, any melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

#### Disciple Of Fire

Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it, even as you rip away the protections of others. You have fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level in this class. Any fire damage you deal ignores a target's fire immunity.

At the start of a combat encounter, you gain surges equal to your Victories. Whenever you deal damage with a surge, you can make that damage fire damage.

#### Disciple Of Earth

Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence. You have a +6 bonus to Stamina, plus you gain an additional +3 bonus to Stamina whenever you gain a level beyond 2nd in this class.

#### There Is No Space Between

You gain the following ability.

THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN *Knowledge of the mystery reveals two spaces are the same*

| space.                        |                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Keywords: Magic, Ranged, Void | Type: Maneuver  |
| Distance: Ranged 10           | Target: Special |

**Effect:** You open two size 1 portals in unoccupied spaces in range, which last until you move beyond distance from any portal, end the effect as a maneuver, or are dying. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above the ground. When you or any ally touch a portal, that creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice within 1 square of the other portal. If an enemy is force moved into a portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space chosen by the creature who force moved them.

At the start of each of your turns while the portals are active, you can open a new portal connected to the others. If three or more portals are present, you and your allies choose which portal you emerge from when you enter a portal, and a creature who force moves an enemy into a portal chooses that enemy's destination portal.
