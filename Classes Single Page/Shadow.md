# Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge place you among the elite assassins, spies, and commandos. But more powerful than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemy's weakness.

As a shadow, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, let you move swiftly across the battlefield and away from hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the middle of the most heated combat encounter. You also possess more skills than any other hero.

## 1st-level Features

As a shadow, you gain the following features.

### Shadow College

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You are one of the few who has graduated from a shadow college, chosen from the following options:

- **College of Black Ash:** The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.
- **College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.
- **College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You gain the Lie skill.

Your choice of shadow college determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them. You have a Heroic Resource called insight.

#### Insight In Combat

When combat begins, gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight. Additionally, the first time each round that you deal damage with an ability that has a power roll and at least one `(SURGE)`, you gain 1 insight.

When combat ends, you lose all of your insight.

Your heroic abilities that have a power roll cost 1 less insight for each edge you have on the ability power roll ( maximum of 2). If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced by the highest amount of edges you have that applies to one target. Banes don't subtract from edges for the purpose of reducing the insight cost of heroic abilities.

#### Insight Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs insight outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight on it equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level College Features

Your choice of college grants you one or two features, as shown on the 1st-Level Shadow College Features table.

#### 1st-level Shadow College Features

| College         | Feature                    |

In a swirl of black ash, you step from one place to another.

| :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Attack, Melee, Ranged, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1 or Ranged 5           | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** You teleport up to 5 squares. If you end this movement in concealment or cover, you can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed. If you attack another creature while hidden from this ability or on the same turn after using this ability, the attack gains `(SURGE)`.

**Spend Insight:** You teleport 1 additional square for each insight spent.

#### Coat The Blade

You gain the following ability.

##### Coat The Blade

Just a little poison goes a long way.

**Effect:** You coat one of your weapons with a harmful poison. The next creature you damage with an ability that uses that weapon takes `(SURGE)` poison damage. The poison loses its potency after you damage the creature or at the end of the encounter.

**Spend Insight:** For each insight you spend, add `(SURGE)` to the effect.

#### I'm On Your Side

You gain the following ability.

##### I'm On Your Side

Taking on the illusory countenance of another creature gives you an advantage on subterfuge.

**Effect:** Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours, and who is within 10 squares of you. Your body is covered in an illusion that makes you appear to be that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and changes your voice to sound like the creature. While this illusion lasts, you gain an edge and `(SURGE)` on attacks against the creature's allies. You also gain an edge on tests made to convince that creature's allies that you are the creature who you appear to be. These benefits don't apply against the creature whose appearance you've taken on. The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you and another creature physically interact, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required).

#### Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to make it easy for you to distract and get away from foes. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and don't start in cover or concealment. If you do, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility. If you end this movement in cover or concealment, you are hidden.

### College Triggered Action

Your college grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Shadow Triggered Actions table.
