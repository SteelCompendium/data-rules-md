# Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge places you among the elite assassins, spies, and commandos. But more powerful than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemies' weaknesses.

As a shadow, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, let you move swiftly across the battlefield and away from hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the middle of the most heated combat encounter. You also possess more skills than any other hero.

## 1st-level Features

As a shadow, you gain the following features.

### Shadow College

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out or are kicked out--as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You graduated from a shadow college chosen from the following options, each of which grants you a skill (*Quick Build:* College of Black Ash):

- **College of Black Ash:** The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.
- **College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.
- **College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You gain the Lie skill.

Your choice of shadow college determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them, building up a Heroic Resource called insight.

#### Insight In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight. The first time each round that you deal damage with at least one surge, you gain 1 insight. You lose any remaining insight at the end of the encounter.

When you use a heroic ability that has a power roll, that ability costs 1 less insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability has an edge or double edge against only one target.

#### Insight Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight on it equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level College Features
