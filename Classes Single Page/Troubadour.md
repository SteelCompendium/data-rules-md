# Troubadour

The world's a stage and all its people actors. No one knows this better than the troubadour. You find energy in the drama of everyday life and know how to draw spectacle forth from even the most mundane of situations. You accent highs and deepen lows in service to whomever would witness your performance.

And beyond the mundane, there are insurmountable dangers that cause many a hero to cower. But the troubadour must chase that drama. The troubadour takes the world stage not to die, but to find out if they are truly alive.

## Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:

- 2, -1, -1
- 1, 1, -1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Presence score â 1\
**Average Potency:** Presence score\
**Strong Potency:** Presence score + 1

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18\
**Stamina Gained at 2nd and greater levels:** 9\
**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You have Read Person and choose two skills from the interpersonal group and one skill from the intrigue or lore groups.

## 1st-level Features

As a troubadour, you gain the following features.

### Class Act

Panache, melody, and depiction. Some troubadours have it all, but everyone starts somewhere. Your class act is your artform, the manner in which you go about unearthing the drama of everyday life and strife.

Choose one of the following class acts. Your choice determines your Act features and Act triggered action in addition to several features you get at later levels.

- **Duelist:** Drama embraces your every movement done in tandem with another. You perform dances of death, putting trust in your opponent to return your passion in kind. You gain the Gymnastics skill.
- **Virtuoso:** You find drama in music and song, weaving magic between the vibrations of your sound and filling the audience with your pathos. You wield an instrument. You gain the Music skill.
- **Skald:** You seek drama from story and recount, using your magic to manipulate the sequence of events unfolding before you. You gain the Brag skill.

### Drama

You are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and upside downs of battle. You have a Heroic Resource called drama.

#### Drama In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

You gain additional drama whenever any of the following events occur during battle:

- A creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20: 3 drama
- The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn: 2 drama
- The first time a hero becomes winded: 2 drama
- A hero, including you, dies: 10 drama

You still gain drama during combat while you are dead and your body is intact. During the encounter you died in, if you have 30 drama accrued, you can choose to come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama as no action. You can't gain drama in future encounters while you remain dead.

Your drama disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### Drama Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs drama outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

### Scene Partner

When you use an interpersonal skill on a test while interacting with an NPC like a bystander or a rival without failing, you can choose to form a bond with them. During negotiations with this NPC, their patience increases by 1 and compelling arguments you personally make to the NPC that would increase their interest by 1 instead increase their interest by 2. You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level, losing a bond of your choice whenever you make a new bond beyond your limit.

### Curtain Call

You enter every performance with a set of routines at the ready. Routines are auras and other wide-reaching effects that center around you while you take action. At the start of each round of combat and at the start of each of your turns, while you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either set a new routine to be active or maintain your current routine. Your routine ends when you are unable to make this choice or at the end of the encounter.

You have access to the following **Choreography** routine. Your Class Act determines any additional routines you can select from.

#### Choreography

*Taps, kicks, steps. Now it's all âchoreography.â*

When you roll to gain drama, you can make your appeal and gain the additional effects (no action required):

- If your drama roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama, but the Director also gains 1 Malice.

When you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use your action to introduce you and your allies to your opponents.

#### Formal Introductions

As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival, such as a calling card or a formal letter, addressed to an enemy and have it delivered. You can choose to deliver it to the target personally, via a courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can only have one notice active at a time.

It is up to the Director when the target receives the notice. Once the target receives your notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per round during future encounters involving the target. You and your allies start these encounters with 2 additional hero tokens. These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.

#### My Reputation Precedes Me

You can choose to invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with a community that hasn't met you before, automatically creating a bond with a representative NPC as if using your Scene Partner feature.

The Director may choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond and make you infamous with the community instead. All present heroes have a bane on interpersonal skill tests with the community until actions are taken to improve your reputations. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the community.

##### Guest Star (5 Drama)

*We offered them a percentage of the gross. So, they're working for free!*

**Effect:** Either a bystander within distance is uplifted by your magic, or a mysterious new hero appears in an unoccupied space to help out during the encounter. The target is controlled by you, has their own separate turn, shares your characteristics and your maximum Stamina, and uses your melee and ranged weapon free strikes to attack. When the target is reduced to 0 Stamina or at the end of the encounter, they retreat (or revert to a bystander). A bystander can't be uplifted in this way more than once in a single encounter.

##### Twist At The End (5 Drama)

*You didn't see that coming, did you?!*

**Effect:** The target comes back to life with half their Stamina as an ally under the Director's control. The heroes can discuss with the Director when the target should take their turn each round. The target turns to dust and blows away at the end of the encounter.

#### Recast A Supporting Part

If you aren't surprised at the beginning of an encounter, you can choose one non-boss or non-solo enemy within line of effect and have the director swap them out with a squad of minions that doesn't exceed the enemy's encounter value. This can't be used against an enemy directly associated with a special objective.

Secondary effects that grapple or force move the target don't happen if you aren't within the distance of the ability. On each of your turns, you can take a free maneuver to communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either giving them (SURGE)(SURGE) or a bane on the next attack they use before the start of your next turn.
