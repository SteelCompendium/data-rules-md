# Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the unknown. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, put an enemy exactly where you want them, debilitate foes with harmful effects, ward yourself and allies against danger, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your choice of elemental specialization determines which of these things you do best.

## Basics

- **Starting Characteristics**: You start with a Reason of 2 and an Intuition of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:
  - 2, −1, −1
  - 1, 1, −1
  - 1, 0, 0
- **Starting Stamina at 1st Level**: 15
- **Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels**: 6
- **Recoveries**: 8
- **Skills**: You gain Magic and can choose any three skills from the crafting or lore skill groups.

## 1st-level Features

As an elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of allies.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.

Heroic abilities that include your specialization's keyword have their initial essence cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1). This reduced cost doesn't apply to abilities you gain because of your specialization, such as Manipulate Earth or Void Sight.

Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence. In times of great stress, you can focus your control on this substance, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds, you have essence equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this essence outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it. You can also dedicate that essence to maintaining persistent abilities (see Persistent Magic below).

When combat begins, you keep any essence you had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. When combat ends, you once more have essence equal to your Victories.

### Hurl Element

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike:

#### Hurl Element

You hurl a ball of elemental energy at a nearby foe.

|                                                |                     |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Earth, Persistent, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 5                         | **Target:** Special |

**Power Roll + Reason**:

- 11 or lower: 2 damage (type varies)
- 12–16: 6 damage (type varies)
- 17+: 9 damage (type varies)

**Effect**: When you make this attack, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have the Persistent keyword. Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end when combat ends.

You can maintain a persistent ability outside of combat as long as you have Victories equal to or greater than its persistent value. If you maintain a persistent ability outside of combat, the maximum essence you can use on other abilities is reduced by the ability's persistent value. For instance, if you have 4 Victories and maintain the Stone Ward ability (a persistent ability with a cost of 1 essence), you can only use abilities costing 3 essence or less outside of combat.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

Whenever you take damage while you have an active persistent ability, you must make the following power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason**:

- 11 or lower: You lose all active persistent abilities.
- 12–16: If you have only one persistent ability active, it remains active. Otherwise, you lose one active persistent ability of your choice.
- 17+: All your active persistent abilities remain active.

### Practical Magic

You have the following ability:

#### Practical Magic

Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your magic.

**Effect**: Choose one of the following effects:

- You use the Knockback maneuver, but you make a Reason test instead of a Might test. For this use of the maneuver, you can target a creature at a distance equal to the distance of your Hurl Element ability.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and deal damage to that creature equal to your Reason score. The damage type can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.
- You teleport a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### 1st-level Specialization Feature

Your elementalist specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elementalist Specialization Features table.

#### 1st-level Elementalist Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature            |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Earth          | Manipulate Earth   |
| Fire           | Melt               |
| Green          | Speech of the Wild |
| Void           | Void Sense         |

#### Manipulate Earth

You gain the following ability:

##### Manipulate Earth (2 Essence)

The earth rises, falls, or opens at your command.

**Effect**: You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

**Alternative Effect**: You touch a structure of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that takes up at least 2 squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it.

**Alternative Effect**: You touch a doorway or other opening in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface that is no larger than 1 square. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

**Spend No Essence**: You can use this ability without spending essence. If you do, you must spend 1 uninterrupted minute using the ability while within reach of the target before its effect occurs.

#### Melt

You gain the following ability:

##### Melt (2 Essence)

With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn into slag or ash.

**Effect**: You heat the target and cause it to combust and melt. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object that you touch is destroyed.

**Spend No Essence**: You can use this ability without spending essence. If you do, you must spend 1 uninterrupted minute using the ability while touching the target before its effect occurs.

#### Speech Of The Wild

You can speak with and understand Animals, Plant Creatures, and Monstrosities, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with such creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent or less hostile toward you.

Additionally, when you touch a living plant object, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

#### Void Sense

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. You always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability:

##### Shared Void Sense (1+ Essence)

You share your special senses with others.

**Effect**: For each essence you spend, you can target 1 creature. That creature gains the benefit of your Void Sense feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of Shared Void Sense.

### Specialization Triggered Action

Your specialization grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Elementalist Triggered Actions table.
