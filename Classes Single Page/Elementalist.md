# Elementalist

Air for movement. Earth for permanence. Fire for destruction. Water for change. Green for growth. Rot for death. Void for the mystery. Years of study and practice and poring over tomes brought you the revelations that allow you to manipulate these building blocks of reality. Now you use your mastery of the seven elements to destroy, create, and warp the world with magic.

As an elementalist, you can unleash your wrath across a field of foes, put an enemy exactly where you want them, debilitate foes with harmful effects, ward yourself and allies against danger, manipulate terrain, warp space, and more. Your choice of elemental specialization determines which of these things you do best.

- 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason score - 1

**Average Potency:** Reason score

## 1st-level Features

As an elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of allies.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.

Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain from this class, including one of the benefits below.

#### Acolyte Of Earth

You gain this feature if earth is your specialization. When earth magic flows through you, you know how to harness it to become harder to move. When you use a magic ability that has the Earth keyword, your Stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn.

#### Acolyte Of Fire

You gain this feature if fire is your specialization. You are an expert at wielding destructive flames. When you deal damage with a magic ability that has the Fire keyword, you deal an additional 1 damage.

#### Acolyte Of The Green

You gain this feature if green is your specialization. You can harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. When you deal damage to at least one creature with a magic ability that has the Green keyword and costs essence to use, you or a creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains Temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score. This temporary stamina disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### Acolyte Of The Mystery

You gain this feature if void is your specialization. You are immersed in the mystery of void magic and can hold onto it longer than other mages. The distance of all your magic abilities with the Void and Ranged keywords increases by 5.

### Essence

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence. In times of great stress, you can focus your control on this substance, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

#### Essence In Combat

When combat begins, gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. When combat ends, you lose all of your essence.

#### Essence Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs essence outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories outside of combat.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence on it equal to your Victories.

### Hurl Element

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike:

#### Hurl Element

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at a nearby foe.*

|                                                     |                     |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Area, Fire, Magic, Persistent, Ranged | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** 10 wall within 10                     | **Target:** Special |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **11 or lower:** 2 damage
- **12-16:** 4 damage
- **17+:** 6 damage

**Effect:** When you make this attack, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

### Persistent Magic

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry, like *Instantaneous Excavation*, which has an effect noted as “Persistent 1.” Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability's persistent value, which enables the ability's persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end when combat ends.

You can't maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can't be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.

If you take damage equal to 5 × your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For example, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining *Instantaneous Excavation* and take 10 or more damage in one turn, you stop maintaining the ability.

### Practical Magic

You have the following ability:

#### Practical Magic

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:

- You use the Knockback maneuver, but you make a Reason ability power roll instead of a Might ability power roll. For this use of the maneuver, you can target a creature at a distance equal to the distance of your *Hurl Element* ability.
- You choose a creature within the distance of your *Hurl Element* ability and deal 1 surge damage to them. The damage type can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.
- You teleport a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### 1st-level Specialization Feature

Your elementalist specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elementalist Specialization Features table.

#### 1st-level Elementalist Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Earth          | Motivate Earth             |
| Fire           | Return to Formlessness     |
| Green          | It Is the Soul Which Hears |
| Void           | A Beyonding of Vision      |

#### A Beyonding Of Vision

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can't conceal creatures and objects from you. You always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and the specifics of what that magic can do.

You also gain the following ability.

##### A Shared Revealing

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target 1 creature. That creature gains the benefit of your *A Beyonding of Vision* feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of *A Shared Revealing*.

#### It Is The Soul Which Hears

You can speak with and understand Animals, Plant Creatures, and Monstrosities, even if they don't share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with such creatures doesn't make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason in place of Presence while making a Presence test to influence them.

Additionally, when you touch a living plant object, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can't be overly specific.

#### Motivate Earth

You gain the following ability:

##### Motivate Earth

*The earth rises, falls, or opens at your command.*

**Effect:** You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a 5-square wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include the square you touched.

**Alternative Effect:** You touch a structure of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that takes up at least 2 squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where you touched it.

**Alternative Effect:** You touch a doorway or other opening in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface that is no larger than 1 square. The opening is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.

#### Return To Formlessness

You gain the following ability:

##### Return To Formlessness

*With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn to slag or ash.*

**Effect:** You heat the target and cause it to combust and melt. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object that you touch is destroyed.

### Specialization Triggered Action

Your specialization grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Elementalist Triggered Actions table.

#### Elementalist Triggered Actions

| Specialization | Triggered Action              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Earth          | Skin Like Castle Walls        |
| Fire           | Explosive Assistance          |
| Green          | The Breath of Dawn Remembered |
| Void           | A Subtle Relocation           |

#### The Breath Of Dawn Remembered

*The power you channel grants the ability to get back in the fight.*

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn.

**Effect:** The target can spend a Recovery. You gain 1 essence.

#### Explosive Assistance

**Trigger:** The target force moves a creature or object.

**Effect:** The distance of the forced movement is increased by a number of squares equal to your Reason score. You gain 1 essence.

#### Skin Like Castle Walls

*You imbue an attack with the strength of stone.*

**Trigger:** The target makes a melee attack.

**Effect:** The attack gains 1 surge. You gain 1 essence.

**Spend 1 Essence:** The attack also pushes the target a number of squares equal to your Reason score after all its other effects are resolved. You gain no essence from using this triggered action.

#### A Subtle Relocation

*You call on the void to swallow and spit out an ally.*

**Trigger:** The target starts their turn or moves.

**Effect:** At any point during the move, you teleport the target a number of squares equal to your Reason. You gain 1 essence.

**Spend 1 Essence:** You teleport the target a number of squares equal to twice your Reason score instead. You gain no essence from using this triggered action.

### Enchantment

You weave an elemental enchantment into your body that enhances your statistics. You can change your enchantment along with your ward (see Elementalist Ward) by performing a complex ritual spell as a respite activity.

#### Enchantment Of Battle

*You tap into the elemental mysteries to gain the mind and training of a warrior.*

You can wear medium armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don't have a kit. While you wear medium armor, you gain a +6 bonus to Stamina. While you wield a light weapon, you deal 1 extra damage with abilities that have the Weapon keyword, including free strikes. You can use medium armor and light weapon treasures. If you have a kit, you can't take this prayer.

Your Stamina increases by 3 and stability increases by 1.

### Elementalist Ward

You can choose one of the following wards. You can change your ward along with your enchantment (see Enchantment) by performing a complex ritual spell as a respite activity.

#### Ward Of Delightful Consequences

*You create a protective field made of void magic that absorbs violence aimed at you and stores it for vengeance.*

Your ward stores the energy of incoming harm and allows you to hurl it back at your enemies. When you take damage, the next magic ability you use that deals damage before the end of your next turn deals additional damage to one target equal to your Reason score. This effect isn't cumulative.

#### Ward Of Excellent Protection

*The protective shield you weave around yourself is made of all the elements.*

Your magic protects you from the elements. You have immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, and lightning equal to your level.

#### Ward Of Nature's Affection

*You store green energy within your body.*

When a creature within a number of squares equal to your Reason score deals damage to you, you can pull them up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

As a 2nd-level elementalist, you gain the following features.

### Perk

You gain a crafting, lore, or supernatural perk of your choice. See Perks for more information.

### 2nd-level Specialization Feature

Additionally, your specialization grants you a feature as shown on the 2nd-Level Elementalist Specialization Features table.

#### 2nd-level Elementalist Specialization Features

| Specialization | Feature                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Earth          | Extra Shield, Disciple of Earth        |
| Fire           | Extra Surge, Disciple of Fire          |
| Green          | Disciple of the Green, Extra Shield    |
| Void           | There is No Space Between, Extra Surge |

#### Disciple Of The Green

*You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a form on the Green Animal Forms table.*

When you make this change, your statistics, except for those noted on the table, remain the same. You choose the exact animal and your appearance in this form. For example, if you become a rodent, you decide if you are a mouse, rat, shrew, or other size-1T rodent that fits the description.

While in these forms, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Other than exceptions noted in this description and on the table, your statistics remain the same.

Some forms have a prerequisite level you must achieve in this class before you can use them. Some of these forms allow you to gain Temporary Stamina. You gain this Temporary Stamina while you are in the form and lose it when you revert back to your true form.

When you make this change, you decide which pieces of your equipment meld into your new form or fall unharmed to the ground. When you change back, melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

#### Disciple Of Fire

*Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it and rip away the protections of others.*

You gain fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level in this class. In addition, your fire damage dealt by you ignores other creature's fire immunities. Finally, when you deal damage with a fire ability, the damage is increased by an amount equal to your Reason score.

#### Disciple Of Earth

*Your body is strengthened by your mind's connection to the element of permanence.*

Your Stamina increases by 6, and you gain an additional 3 Stamina whenever you gain a level beyond 2nd in this class. Additionally, when you are forced to make a Might resistance roll, you can make a Reason resistance roll instead.

#### Extra Shield

Your `(SHIELD)` limit increases by 1, for a maximum of `(SHIELD)(SHIELD)(SHIELD)(SHIELD)`.

#### Extra Surge

Your `(SURGE)` limit increases by 1, for a maximum of `(SURGE)(SURGE)(SURGE)(SURGE)`.

#### There Is No Space Between

You gain the following ability:

##### There Is No Space Between

*Knowledge of the mystery reveals two spaces are the same space.*

**Effect:** You open two size-1 portals in unoccupied spaces that last until the start of your next turn. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above ground. When you or an ally touches a portal, the creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice within 1 square of the other portal. If an enemy is forced moved into the portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space of your choice.

**Persistent 0:** If the portals are within distance at the start of your next turn, they remain open until the start of your next turn. Additionally, you can open another portal that is connected to the others. When three or more portals exist, you and allies choose which other portal you emerge from when you enter one, and you choose which other portal enemies emerge from when they are force moved into one.

#### Green Animal Forms
