# Talent

The talent is a master of psionics--a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind. In rare occurrences, people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent's abilities, can actually tap into the mind's full strength.

A talent is limited only by the strength of their mind. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But with this limitless potential comes a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent, and those who use too many too quickly die from the exertion.

## 1st-level Features

As a talent, you gain the following features.

### Talent Tradition

Psionic abilities are grouped into specific categories according to their power and effects. Each category comprises one of many talent traditions, including the following:

**Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things

- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air of the environment around you
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it

**Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects

- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures As a talent gains mastery over their mind, they are drawn to a tradition that can be manifested as easily as breathing. Choose one of the following talent traditions: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. (*Quick Build:* telekinesis) Your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain from this class. (Other talent traditions will be featured in future products.)

### Clarity And Strain

The focus and precision of your thoughts grants you a Heroic Resource called clarity that empowers your psionic abilities.

#### Clarity In Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 clarity. You gain 1 clarity the first time each round that a creature is force moved.

You can spend clarity you do not have, pushing that Heroic Resource into negative numbers, to a maximum negative value equal to 1 + your Reason score. At the end of each of your turns, you take 1 damage for each negative point of clarity.

Whenever you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

You lose any remaining clarity or reset any negative clarity at the end of the encounter.

#### Clarity Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs clarity, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

Additionally, if you use two or more abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using those abilities or effects.

If you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect, such as Minor Telekinesis, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.

### Mind Spike

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike.

### Mind Spike

*A telepathic bolt instantly zaps a creature's brain.*

|                                                                                                                    |                                    |
