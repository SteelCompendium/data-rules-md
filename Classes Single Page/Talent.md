# Talent

The talent is a master of psionics, a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature's mind. In rare occurrences, people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent's abilities, can actually tap into the mind's strength.

The talent is limited only by the strength of their mind. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But with this limitless potential comes a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent, and those who use too many too quickly die from the exertion.

## 1st-level Features

As a talent, you gain the following features:

### Tradition

Psionic abilities manifest into one of multiple categories. Some examples of categories include:

- **Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.
- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air within and around the environment.
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits.
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.
- **Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.
- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.

As talents gain mastery over their minds, they find a tradition for one psionic category that's as easy to manifest as it is to breathe. Choose one of the following categories to be your tradition: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. Other talent affinities will be featured in future products. Your choice determines your Tradition Triggered Action and Tradition Features in addition to several features you get at later levels.

### Clarity And Strain

Your mind is your greatest asset, and the clarity of your thoughts is what empowers your psionic abilities. You have a heroic resource called clarity.

#### Clarity In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns in combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.

You can choose to spend clarity you do not have, going into negative numbers. Your negative clarity limit is equal to 1 + your Reason. At the end of your turn, you take 1d6 damage for each clarity you have below 0.

While you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

Your clarity disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### Clarity Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. If you use two or more heroic abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using them.

Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs clarity outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.

### Mind Spike

You can fire a bolt of psychic energy into an enemy's mind. You gain access to the Mind Spike ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike:

#### Mind Spike

*A telepathic bolt that instantly zaps a creature's brain.*

|                                                   |                        |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Animapathy, Attack, Psionic, Ranged | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                           | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 17+: 6 psychic damage

**Strained:** The attack deals an extra 2 psychic damage to the target and yourself. This damage ignores your immunities.

### Telepathic Speech

You know the Mindspeech language. You can also telepathically communicate with creatures within the distance of your Mind Spike ability if they share a language with you and you know of each other. The receiver of your telepathic communications can choose to respond telepathically.
