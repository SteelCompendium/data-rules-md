# Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you, you unleash it! Like a raptor, a panther, a wolf, your experience in the wild taught you the secret of channeling unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial chaos is your ally. Leave it to others to use finesse to clean up the pieces you leave behind.

As a fury, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, move you around the battlefield, and grow in strength as your rage increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.

## Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and an Agility of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:

- 2, -1, -1
- 1, 1, -1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Might score - 1\
**Average Potency:** Might score\
**Strong Potency:** Might score + 1

## 1st-level Features

As a fury, you gain the following features.

### Primordial Aspect

You come from a tradition older than civilization, older than warfare, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the Timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and which left an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you channel the rage that shapes you, you can choose a primordial aspect from the following:

- **Berserker:** You channel your rage into expressions of physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your rage into instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of civilization. You gain the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your rage into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain the Track skill.

Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Rage

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

#### Rage In Combat

When a combat encounter begins, you gain rage equal to your Victories. At the start of each turn of combat, you gain 1d3 rage. The first time in a round that you take damage, you gain 1 rage. Your rage disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### Rage Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain rage outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost rage without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs rage outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited rage on its effect, such as *To the Uttermost End*, out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of rage on it equal to your Victories.

### Growing Rage

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of rage you have. See Aspect Features for details. The benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of rage you spend during your turn.

### 1st-level Aspect Features

Your chosen primordial aspect grants you features as shown on the 1st-Level Primordial Aspect Features table.

#### 1st-level Primordial Aspect Features

| Aspect     | Feature                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Berserker  | Kit, Primordial Strength       |
| Reaver     | Kit, Primordial Cunning        |
| Stormwight | Beast Shape, Relentless Hunter |

#### Beast Shape

When you select a martial kit, you can instead select a stormwight kit (see Stormwight Kits). Your stormwight kit grants you a number of benefits, including effects tied to your Growing Rage feature.

#### Kit

You can use and gain the benefits of a kit. See the Kits chapter for more information.

#### Primordial Cunning

You are never surprised. Additionally, whenever you would push a target with forced movement, you can slide them instead. As your rage grows, your primordial cunning intensifies.

### Aspect Triggered Action

| Aspect     | Triggered Action   |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Berserker  | Lines of Force     |
| Reaver     | Unearthly Reflexes |
| Stormwight | Furious Change     |

#### Furious Change

In your anger, you revert to a more bestial form.

|                                             |                                  |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Animal, Attack, Melee, Weapon | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Reach                         | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

**Trigger:** You lose Stamina and are not dying.\
**Effect:** After damage is resolved, if your rage is high enough, you can enter your animal or hybrid form as a free triggered action. You gain temporary Stamina equal to your Might.\
**Spend 3 Rage:** If you are not dying, you can spend a Recovery.

#### Lines Of Force

You redirect the energy of motion.

**Trigger:** The target is force moved.\
**Effect:** You can select a new target of the same size or smaller within distance to be force moved instead and change the direction of that forced movement. Additionally, you can increase the forced move distance by a number of squares equal to your Might score.\
**Spend 1 Rage:** You can increase the forced move distance by a number of squares equal to twice your Might score instead.

#### Unearthly Reflexes

Elusive as a hummingbird.

**Trigger:** You are targeted by a damaging area of effect.\
**Effect:** You shift up to 2 squares. If that moves you out of the area of effect, you ignore the attack. Otherwise, you take half damage.\
**Spend 3 Rage:** You move a willing adjacent ally affected by the attack with you, applying the same outcome to them.

### Mighty Leaps

You always succeed on Might tests made to jump. You can still roll to see if you get a reward result.

### Where's My Maneuver?

Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, during playtesting many folks asked, “Where is the fury's special maneuver?” The fury doesn't need a maneuver all their own because most of the time we've found that the fantasy of the fury has them using the **Knockback** or **Grab** maneuvers in combat. They're really good at it too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.

### Fury Abilities
