# Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you, you unleash it! Like a raptor, a panther, a wolf, your experience in the wild taught you the secret of channeling unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial chaos is your ally. Leave it to others to use finesse to clean up the pieces you leave behind.

As a fury, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, move you around the battlefield, and grow in strength as your rage increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.

## Basics

- **Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and an Agility of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:
  - 2, −1, −1
  - 1, 1, −1
  - 1, 0, 0
- **Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21
- **Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 10
- **Recoveries:** 12
- **Skills:** Nature, plus choose any two skills from the exploration or intrigue skill groups.

## 1st-level Features

As a fury, you gain the following features.

### Primordial Aspect

You come from a tradition older than civilization, older than warfare, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and which left an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you channel the rage that shapes you, you can choose a primordial aspect from the following:

- **Berserker:** You channel your rage into expressions of physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your rage into instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of civilization. You gain the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your rage into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain the Track skill.

Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Rage

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds, you have fury equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this rage outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.

When a combat encounter begins, you keep any rage you had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 rage. When combat ends, you once again have rage equal to your Victories.

### Growing Rage

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of rage you have. See Aspect Features for details. The benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of rage you spend during your turn.

### Mighty Leaps

You always succeed on Might tests made to jump. You can still roll to see if you get a reward result.

### 1st-level Aspect Features

Your chosen primordial aspect grants you features as shown on the 1st-Level Primordial Aspect Features table.

#### 1st-level Primordial Aspect Features

| Aspect     | Feature                             |

| Berserker  | Primordial Strength                 |
| Reaver     | Primordial Cunning                  |
| Stormwight | Primordial Shape, Relentless Hunter |

#### Primordial Cunning

You are never surprised. Additionally, whenever you would push a target with forced movement, you can slide them instead.

As your rage grows, your primordial cunning intensifies. These benefits are cumulative.

#### Primordial Strength

When you damage an object with a weapon attack, it takes an additional 5 damage. Additionally, whenever you push another creature, you can make it a vertical push.
