**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, the area of your null field increases to 2 aura. While affected by this aura, you and your allies ignore difficult terrain, reduce potency of enemy effects that target them by 1, and remove a condition or effect that is affecting them as a free triggered action at the beginning of their turns.
