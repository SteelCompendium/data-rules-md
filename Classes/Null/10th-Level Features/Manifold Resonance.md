# Manifold Resonance

Your body becomes perfected matter, beyond the whims and chaos of the timescape and the restrictions of the manifolds. When you take a respite, you can shift yourself and any creatures within your null field to any other location in the timescape known to you, known to any creature in your null field, or where any treasure in your null field has been before.

Additionally, you and allies in your null field ignore all banes.

You also receive one free discipline per action that can be used for psi boosts.
