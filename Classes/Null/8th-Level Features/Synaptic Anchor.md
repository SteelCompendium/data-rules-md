**Trigger:** The target takes damage from another creature's ability while in your Null Field.

**Effect:** You halve the damage, and the creature who used the triggering ability suffers **I \< \[average\] dazed (save ends).** While the attacker is dazed, they take psychic damage equal to your Intuition score whenever they take an action.
