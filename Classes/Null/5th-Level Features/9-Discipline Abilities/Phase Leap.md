*You leap beyond reality, leaving an afterimage of yourself.*

| **Keywords:** Psionic | **Type:** Move   |
| **Distance:** Self    | **Target:** Self |

**Effect:** You jump your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Until the end of your next turn, an afterimage of yourself is left in the space you left. Enemies adjacent to your afterimage have a bane on all ability power rolls. Your abilities have line of effect from your afterimage as well as yourself.
