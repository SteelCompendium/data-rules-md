# Realitas (11 Discipline)

*Your essential hyperreality disrupts your enemy's connection to existence.* **Keywords:** Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon

|                       |                        |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:**         | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1 | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

o *11 or lower:* **7 + A psychic damage; I \< \[weak\] dazed**

- *12-16:* **10 + A psychic damage; I \< \[average\] dazed**
- *17+:* **13 + A psychic damage; I \< \[strong\] dazed**

**Effect:** While dazed, the target takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score at the start of each of your turns. If this ability winds a non-leader or non-solo creature, they are instead reduced to 0 Stamina. Any creature reduced to 0 Stamina by any aspect of this ability is forgotten by all creatures of your level or lower in the timescape not present at the encounter. Loved ones of the forgotten creature retain a faint sense of melancholy.
