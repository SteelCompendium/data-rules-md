| **Keywords:** | **Type:** Maneuver **Distance:** Self |
| **Distance:** | **Target:** Self                      |

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- *11 or lower:* **vertical slide 5**
- *12-16:* **vertical slide 7**
- *17+:* **vertical slide 9**

**Effect:** This movement ignores stability. If you slide into another creature, you resolve damage to both of you as if your force movement ends, but you keep moving through their space.
