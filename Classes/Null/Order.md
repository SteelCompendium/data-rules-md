# Order

You gain an epic resource called order. When you take a Respite, you gain order equal to the XP you gain. You can spend order as if it were discipline on abilities you have.

You can spend 1 order at the start of a combat encounter to increase your Null Field by 1 until the end of the encounter.

Order remains until you spend it.
