# Null

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body. You require no weapons, no tools. Any tool can be turned against the hand that wields it. You suffice.

As you strive for perfect order, you become an enemy of that ultimate expression of chaos: magic. Those who employ sorcery or psionics to break the laws of nature should fear you.

The null is an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs the effects of magic and psionics. You need no weapon because you are the weapon. Play a null if you want to resist the supernatural forces of the universe with expert calm and confidence.

## Null Field

You project a psionic field of order around your body, dampening the effects of supernatural abilities harmful to you and your allies.

#### Null Field

*You intuit where an incoming attack will strike, reducing its effects.*

**Effect:** Each target reduces their potencies by 1.

Once as a free maneuver on your turn, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field has one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:

- **Gravitic Disruption:** When a target takes damage, you can slide them 2.
- **Inertial Anchor:** Each target who starts their turn in the area cannot shift.
- **Synaptic Break:** When a target is subjected to a potency, the potency is increased by 1.

This ability stays active even after encounters end. It ends if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).

## Null Speed

Your psionic mastery of your body allows you to achieve great quickness. You gain a bonus to your speed and a bonus to the number of squares you shift when you take the Disengage move action equal to your Agility score.
