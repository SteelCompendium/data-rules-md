**Effect:** You can place this wall in occupied squares, with each creature in an affected place sliding to the nearest unoccupied square of your choice. The wall lasts until the end of the encounter or you are dying. The wall squares count as stone squares for purposes of damage. You can move freely through the wall squares. Any enemy that enters a square adjacent to the wall is **M \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)**. Any enemy that is force moved into the wall is **M \< \[average\] restrained (save ends)**.
