# Discipline

Mastery of your body and tradition in its use fuel your powers. You have a heroic resource called discipline.

## Discipline In Combat

When a combat encounter begins, you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of your turn in combat, you gain 2 discipline. You gain 1 discipline the first time in a round your null field affects a creature. When combat ends, your discipline drops to 0.

## Discipline Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs discipline outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline on it equal to your Victories.
