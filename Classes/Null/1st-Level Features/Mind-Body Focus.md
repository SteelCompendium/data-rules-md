# Mind-body Focus

Your training has turned your body into the perfect psionic weapon, even beyond that of a trained martial artist. Through psionic meditation, you have created pathways in your mind that enhance your statistics. You can choose one of the following focuses. You can change your focus by undergoing a psionic meditation as a respite activity.

- **Speed Focus:** Your speed increases by 1, and when you take the Disengage move action, you can shift 1 extra square.
- **Force Focus:** When you deal damage with a Psionic ability, the damage dealt increases by 1.
- **Strength Focus:** Your Stamina increases by 3 and stability increases by 1.
