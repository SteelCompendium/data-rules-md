# Null Field

You have the ability to project a psionic field of order around your body. This field dampens the effects of supernatural abilities that attempt to harm you and any allies within.

**Effect:** Until you are dying, attacks with the Magic or Psionic keyword take a bane if they target a target within the aura or are made by an enemy within the aura. Resistance rolls against abilities with the Magic or Psionic keyword have an edge if they target a target within the aura or are used by an enemy within the aura. These effects increase to a double bane or a double edge, respectively, if the creature using the ability is grabbed by you.
