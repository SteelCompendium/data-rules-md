# Anticipating Strike (3 Discipline)

> You foresee the best moment to strike and exploit it.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- 11 or lower: 7 damage
- 12-16: 10 damage
- 17+: 13 damage

**Effect:** You can shift half your speed, before or after you make the attack. You can use this ability instead of a free strike or a signature ability whenever an effect gives you one, though you still must pay its Discipline cost.
