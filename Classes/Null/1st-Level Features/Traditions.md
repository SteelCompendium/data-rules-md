# Traditions

Nulls have learned to unlock the full psionic potential of their bodies through extensive physical training. Where a talent has mastery of the mind, the null has mastery of the body.

Choose one of the following traditions. Your choice determines your tradition features and tradition triggered action in addition to several features you get at later levels.

- **Chronokinetic:** Your training has allowed you to become unmoored from time, using the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain a lore skill.
- **Cryokinetic:** You are able to tap into the most essential energy of the manifolds, absolute cold, and manifest those effects in your body. You gain a crafting skill.
- **Metakinetic:** Many attempt to perfect their bodies, but you have learned to see through the illusions of the universe to understand your true body and its true psionic potential. You gain an exploration skill.
