# Disciple Of The Green

*You can use a maneuver to shapeshift into a form on the Green Animal Forms table.*

When you make this change, your statistics, except for those noted on the table, remain the same. You choose the exact animal and your appearance in this form. For example, if you become a rodent, you decide if you are a mouse, rat, shrew, or other size-1T rodent that fits the description.\
While in these forms, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Other than exceptions noted in this description and on the table, your statistics remain the same.

Some forms have a prerequisite level you must achieve in this class before you can use them. Some of these forms allow you to gain Temporary Stamina. You gain this Temporary Stamina while you are in the form and lose it when you revert back to your true form.\
When you make this change, you decide which pieces of your equipment meld into your new form or fall unharmed to the ground. When you change back, melded gear reappears on your person.

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can't enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can't turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.
