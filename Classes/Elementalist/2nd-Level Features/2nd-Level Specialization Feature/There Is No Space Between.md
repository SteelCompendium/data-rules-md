| **Keywords:** Magic, Persistent, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                       | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** You open two size-1 portals in unoccupied spaces that last until the start of your next turn. Each portal must be placed at a height of no more than 1 square above ground. When you or an ally touches a portal, the creature can choose to be instantly teleported to an unoccupied space of their choice within 1 square of the other portal. If an enemy is forced moved into the portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space of your choice.

**Persistent 0:** If the portals are within distance at the start of your next turn, they remain open until the start of your next turn. Additionally, you can open another portal that is connected to the others. When three or more portals exist, you and allies choose which other portal you emerge from when you enter one, and you choose which other portal enemies emerge from when they are force moved into one.
