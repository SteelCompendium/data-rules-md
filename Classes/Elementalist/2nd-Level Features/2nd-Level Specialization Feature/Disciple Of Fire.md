# Disciple Of Fire

*Your connection to fire allows you to protect yourself from it and rip away the protections of others.*

You gain fire immunity equal to 5 plus your level in this class. In addition, your fire damage dealt by you ignores other creature's fire immunities. Finally, when you deal damage with a fire ability, the damage is increased by an amount equal to your Reason score.
