# A Conversation With Fire

While you are in front of a fire, you can speak the name of another creature as a maneuver. If they are willing to speak to you, their image appears in the fire, and they can see you before them in a shimmering ball of light. You can speak to each other through these images as if you were together in person. The creature or you can end the conversation as a maneuver.
