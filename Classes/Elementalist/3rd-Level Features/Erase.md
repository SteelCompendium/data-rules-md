**Effect:** The number of creatures you target with this ability is determined by your power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **One creature**
- *12-16:* **Two creatures**
- *17+:* **Three creatures**

Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). While fading from existence, a target initially takes a bane on power rolls. At the end of their first turn, they have a double bane on power rolls. At the end of their second turn, they fade from existence for 1 hour, reappearing in their original space or the nearest available space.

- *11 or lower*\*\*: 5 damage\*\*
- *12-16:* **9 damage**
- *17+:* **12 damage**

**Effect:** The ground in or directly beneath the area drops, lowering 3 squares.
