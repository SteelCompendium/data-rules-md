# Erase (7 Essence)

With a flick of the wrist, you phase creatures out of existence.

|                                           |                     |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Attack, Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                   | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). While fading from existence, a target has bane on all power rolls. At the end of their first turn suffering this effect, they have a double bane on all power rolls. At the end of their second turn suffering this effect, they fade from existence for 1 hour, then return to the spot where they left. You can target a number of creatures with this ability equal to your power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 11 or lower: 1 creature
- 12-16: 2 creatures
- 17+: 3 creatures
