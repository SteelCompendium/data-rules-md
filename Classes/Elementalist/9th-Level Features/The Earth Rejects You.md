# The Earth Rejects You (11 Essence)

*Everyone and everything gets blown away in a hail of rocks and debris.*

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* 6 **damage**
- *12-16:* 9 **damage**
- *17+:* 13 **damage**

**Persistent 2:** At the start of your turn, you can use this ability again as a maneuver without spending essence.

THE GREEN DEFENDS ITS SERVANTS (11 ESSENCE) *A luminous green shield that shows its true beauty the more it cracks.*

**Effect:** You conjure an elemental shield that protects the target until the end of your next turn. While the ward is active, the target can take the Defend action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains 30 temporary Stamina that lasts until depleted or the ward is no longer active. When this temporary Stamina disappears, the ward ends. When the ability ends, the ward explodes. Each enemy within 5 of the target takes 10 damage.

**Persistent 2:** The effects persist until the start of your next turn.
