*You teleport the target into the air and let the ground do the rest.*

| **Distance:**                                                                                            | **Target:**                                                               |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower*\*\*: teleport 4 squares\*\*
- *12-16:* **teleport 6 squares**
- *17+:* **teleport 8 squares**

**Effect:** If the target falls and takes damage as if their Agility score were 0 immediately after being teleported, the damage they take from falling is fire damage, and each enemy within 3 of where the target lands takes the same damage. The ground within 3 of where the target lands becomes difficult terrain.

THE WODE REMEMBERS AND RETURNS (9 ESSENCE) *You create a terrarium, from canopy above to underbrush below.*

**Effect:** The affected area becomes dark and verdant with trees and plant life appearing in unoccupied spaces within it until the start of your next turn. The affected area is considered difficult terrain for enemies. Allies that end their turn in the affected area have cover.

**Persistent 2:** Allies within the affected area can spend a Recovery at the start of your turn. The effects persist until the start of your next turn.
