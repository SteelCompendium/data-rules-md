# Elemental Specialization

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, [[Quickness|quickness]], flight, and breath.
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of allies.
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.
- **Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.
- **Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to [[Teleport|teleport]], create illusions, and make things incorporeal.
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.

[[Heroic Abilities|Heroic abilities]] that include your specialization's keyword have their initial [[Essence|essence]] cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1). This reduced cost doesn't apply to abilities you gain because of your specialization, such as Manipulate Earth or Void Sight.

Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.
