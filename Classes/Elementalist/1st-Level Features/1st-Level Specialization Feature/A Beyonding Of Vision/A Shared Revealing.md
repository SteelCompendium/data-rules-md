# A Shared Revealing

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

|                                   |                     |

| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10           | **Target:** Special |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target 1 creature. That creature gains the benefit of your *A Beyonding of Vision* feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of *A Shared Revealing*.
