# Melt (2 Essence)

With the merest touch, you cause an object to turn into slag or ash.

|                                  |                              |

| **Keywords:** Fire, Magic, Melee | **Type:** Action             |
| **Distance:** Reach 1            | **Target:** 1 mundane object |

**Effect**: You heat the target and cause it to combust and melt. If the object is larger than 1 square, then only the square of the object that you touch is destroyed.

**Spend No [[Essence]]**: You can use this ability without spending [[Essence|essence]]. If you do, you must spend 1 uninterrupted minute using the ability while touching the target before its effect occurs.
