# Shared Void Sense (1+ Essence)

You share your special senses with others.

|                                   |                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged, Void | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 5            | **Target:** Special |

**Effect**: For each [[Essence|essence]] you spend, you can target 1 creature. That creature gains the benefit of your Void Sense feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of Shared Void Sense.
