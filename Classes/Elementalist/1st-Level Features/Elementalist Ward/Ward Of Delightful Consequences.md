# Ward Of Delightful Consequences

*You create a protective field made of void magic that absorbs violence aimed at you and stores it for vengeance.*

Your ward stores the energy of incoming harm and allows you to hurl it back at your enemies. When you take damage, the next magic ability you use that deals damage before the end of your next turn deals additional damage to one target equal to your Reason score. This effect isn't cumulative.
