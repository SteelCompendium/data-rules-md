# Acolyte Of The Green

You gain this feature if green is your specialization. You can harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. When you deal damage to at least one creature with a magic ability that has the Green keyword and costs essence to use, you or a creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains Temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score. This temporary stamina disappears at the end of the encounter.
