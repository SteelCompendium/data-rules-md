# Enchantment

You weave an elemental enchantment into your body that enhances your statistics. You can change your enchantment along with your ward (see Elementalist Ward) by performing a complex ritual spell as a respite activity.

## Enchantment Of Battle

*You tap into the elemental mysteries to gain the mind and training of a warrior.*

You can wear medium armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don't have a kit. While you wear medium armor, you gain a +6 bonus to Stamina. While you wield a light weapon, you deal 1 extra damage with abilities that have the Weapon keyword, including free strikes. You can use medium armor and light weapon treasures. If you have a kit, you can't take this prayer.

## Enchantment Of Celerity

*You infuse your body with the speed of elemental air.*

Your speed increases by 1, and when you take the Disengage move action, you can shift 1 extra square.

## Enchantment Of Destruction

*You harness the destruction of flame inside your mind, allowing you to focus your magic on destroying your enemies.*

When you deal damage with a Magic ability, the damage dealt increases by 1.

## Enchantment Of Distance

*You reach into the mysteries of the void and mix that element with all of your abilities.*

The ranged distance of your abilities with the Ranged and Magic keywords increases by 5.

## Enchantment Of Permanence

*You place the magic of earth into your flesh and bones, making you tougher and harder to move.*

Your Stamina increases by 3 and stability increases by 1.
