# Troubadour

The whole world's a stage and everyone on it, an actor. No one knows this better than the troubadour. You find energy in the drama of everyday life and know how to draw spectacle forth from even the most mundane of situations. You accent highs and deepen lows in service to whomever would witness your performance.

And beyond the mundane, there are insurmountable dangers that cause many a hero to cower. But the troubadour must chase that drama. The troubadour takes the world stage not to die, but to find out if they are truly alive.
