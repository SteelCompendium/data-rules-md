# Careful Observation

Given the chance to watch your foe, you can assess their vulnerabilities and pick the perfect moment to strike. As a maneuver, you observe and take aim at a creature within 20 squares of you. If you do, you gain an edge on the next attack you make against that foe and the attack deals an extra \[SURGE\] damage, provided you attack no other creature before attacking the one you observe, stay within 20 squares of them, and don't lose line of effect to them. You can stack the effects of this feature on a single creature up to four times.
