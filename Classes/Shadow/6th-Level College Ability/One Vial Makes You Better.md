# One Vial Makes You Better (9 Insight)

*This quick brew crackles and pops violently yet emits a sickly-sweet aroma.*

| **Distance:**                                                                                   | **Target:** |

**Effect:** You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target. A target can immediately quaff the potion (no action required). If they don't drink the potion right away, they must use the Drink Potion maneuver to consume it later. The potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter.

A creature that drinks a balanced concoction can spend up to 2 Recoveries and gains acid immunity, fire immunity, or poison immunity equal to your level until the end of the encounter.
