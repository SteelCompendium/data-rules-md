| **Distance:**                                                                                           | **Target:** |

**Effect:** Roll power for this ability. You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target. A target can immediately quaff the potion (no action required) or keep it handy. If they don't drink the potion right away, they must use the Drink Potion maneuver to consume it later. The potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter.

A creature that drinks a concerning concoction gains the effects of your power roll.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- *11 or lower:* **The creature's speed is increased by 2 until the end of the encounter**
- *12-16:* **The creature's speed gains the Fly keyword until the end of the encounter**
- *17+:* **The creature turns invisible until the end** of **their next turn.**
