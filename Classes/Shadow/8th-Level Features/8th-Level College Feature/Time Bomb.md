# Time Bomb

*The longer it cooks, the bigger the boom.*

For each round in combat that Time Bomb is not used, the area of the cube is increased by 1 and a surge is added to the damage of this ability and can't be used on any other. After using Time Bomb or at the end of the encounter, its area and surges are reset.

**Spend Insight:** You increase the cube's size by 1 and add a surge to this ability (and only this ability) for every 2 insight spent.
