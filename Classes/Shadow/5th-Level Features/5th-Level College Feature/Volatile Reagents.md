# Volatile Reagents

Whenever you take damage, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire, acid, or poison damage (your choice) equal to your Agility score.

Additionally, your Defensive Roll now allows you to shift 5 and during this movement you can move vertically. If you don't end this movement on solid ground and are not flying, you fall.
