# Harlequin Gambit

Whenever you reduce an adjacent non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use I'm No Threat and then move up to your speed.

If the creature is size 1, you can disguise yourself as the creature with I'm No Threat without spending insight. If you do, while I'm No Threat is active, the creature's body is also disguised to look like your body. The illusion ends on their body when another creature physically interacts with it. When the illusion would end for either you or the creature's body, it ends for both.
