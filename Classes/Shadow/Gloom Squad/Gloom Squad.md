# Gloom Squad

At the start of each of your turns, you can forgo gaining insight to create 1d6 clones of yourself in unoccupied spaces adjacent to you. A clone shares your turn, statistics, and current conditions and effects, except it has 1 Stamina and lasts until the start of your next turn. A clone cannot have insight, use signature strikes, use Careful Observation or Umbral Form or triggered actions, or use any abilities that cost insight. On their turn, a clone has a move action, maneuver, and an action, which they can use to take a free strike. While making a free strike, a clone must choose targets that you or another clone aren't also striking.

Outside of combat, you can have 1 clone active for every 2 Victories you have. If a clone is destroyed, you must wait 1 hour before creating another one.
