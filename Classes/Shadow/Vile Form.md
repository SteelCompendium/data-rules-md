# Vile Form

IT WAS ME ALL ALONG (11 INSIGHT) Your Umbral Form ability is now called Ville Form. You've gained full control over your shadow creature form and can deactivate it at will (no action required). Additionally, you are always in concealment while in this form, keeping you wreathed in darkness, and enemies no longer have an edge on strikes against you because of the form.
