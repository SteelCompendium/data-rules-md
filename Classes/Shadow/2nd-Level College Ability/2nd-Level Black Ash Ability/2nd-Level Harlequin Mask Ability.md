# 2nd-level Harlequin Mask Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

MACHINATIONS OF SOUND (5 INSIGHT)

*Illusory sounds make your foes reposition themselves as they cower or investigate the disturbance.*

| **Keywords:** Attack, Melee, Ranged, Magic, Weapon | **Type:** Free Triggered Action **Distance:** Self; see below **Target:** Self **Trigger:** An enemy strikes you. |
| **Distance:**                                      | **Target:** Each enemy in the area                                                                                |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- *11 or lower:* **Slide 4**
- *12-16:* **Slide 5**
- *17+:* **Slide 7**

**Effect:** This forced movement ignores stability. Instead, the forced movement is reduced by a number equal to the target's Intuition score.

SO GULLIBLE (5 INSIGHT)

*When your enemy strikes, you reveal you were in a different place all along.*

**Effect:** You use your Clever Trick ability with no insight cost, causing the creature who made the triggering strike to target an illusory image of you. You appear in an unoccupied space within 3 squares of that creature and can make a free strike against them. You can then spend a Recovery.
