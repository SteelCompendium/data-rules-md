# Tricks

You have an epic resource called tricks. When you take a Respite, you gain tricks equal to the XP you gain. You can spend tricks as if they were insight on abilities you have.

Additionally, you can spend tricks to take additional maneuvers on your turn. You gain 1 maneuver for every trick you spend during your turn .

Tricks remain until you spend them.
