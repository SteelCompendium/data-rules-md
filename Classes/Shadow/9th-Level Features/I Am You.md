# I Am You (11 Insight)

*Your mask reflects your foe's face. Surely, they won't need it much longer.* **Keywords:** Magic

| **Type:** Maneuver                   |                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
|                                      |                                   |

| **Keywords:**                        | **Type:** Action                  |
| **Distance:** Melee 1                | **Target:** 1 creature or object  |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, you gain the target's speed (unless yours is faster), Speed keywords, and damage immunities (using yours if you have the same and yours are higher), and you have access to the target's signature ability, using their bonus to any power roll.

*After everything you've been through together, you twist the blade and make the pain extra personal.* **Keywords:** Melee, Strike, Weapon

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- *11 or lower:* **15 + A damage**
- *12-16:* **21 + A damage**
- *17+:* **28 + A damage**

**Effect:** If you are disguised as a creature the target knew with your I'm No Threat ability, this ability deals additional damage equal to three times your Agility score.
