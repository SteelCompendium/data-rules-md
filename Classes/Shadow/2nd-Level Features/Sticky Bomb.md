| **Distance:** | **Target:** One creature                 |

**Effect:** You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature otherwise notices the bomb and can remove it as an action, disarming the bomb. At the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. You can also detonate it earlier (no action required). When the bomb detonates, you make a power roll targeting each enemy within 3 squares of it.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- *11 or lower:* **4 + A fire damage**
- *12-16:* **7 + A fire damage**
- *17+:* **11 + A fire damage**
