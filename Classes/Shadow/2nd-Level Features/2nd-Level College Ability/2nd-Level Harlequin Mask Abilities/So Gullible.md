- **Trigger:** You use Clever Trick.

**Effect:** Clever Trick doesn't cost insight to use. The creature who attacked you actually just attacked an illusory image of you. You appear in an unoccupied space within 3 squares of that creature and can make a free strike against them and spend a Recovery.
