# Machinations Of Sound (5 Insight)

Illusory sounds make your foes reposition themselves as they cower or investigate the disturbance.

|                                   |                                |

| **Keywords:** Area, Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver             |
| **Distance:** 3 cube within 10    | **Target:** All enemies within |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- 11 or lower: slide 4
- 12-16: slide 5
- 17+: slide 7

**Effect:** This movement ignores Stability. Instead, the forced movement is reduced by a number equal to the target's Intuition score.
