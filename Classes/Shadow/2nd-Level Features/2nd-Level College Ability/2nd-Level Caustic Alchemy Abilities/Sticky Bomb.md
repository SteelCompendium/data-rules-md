# Sticky Bomb (5 Insight)

Explosives are best when they're attached to an enemy.

|                         |                        |

| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature, they don't notice it and you remain hidden. If they notice the bomb, the creature can remove it as an action. At the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. You can detonate it earlier as no action. When it detonates, make one power roll targeting each enemy within 3 squares of the bomb.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- 11 or lower: 4 fire damage
- 12-16: 7 fire damage
- 17+: 11 fire damage
