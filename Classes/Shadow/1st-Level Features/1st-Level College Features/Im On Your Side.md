You gain the following ability.

## I'm On Your Side

Taking on the illusory countenance of another creature gives you an advantage on subterfuge.

|                     |                    |
| :------------------ | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** Magic | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self  | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours, and who is within 10 squares of you. Your body is covered in an illusion that makes you appear to be that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and changes your voice to sound like the creature. While this illusion lasts, you gain an edge and (SURGE) on attacks against the creature's allies. You also gain an edge on tests made to convince that creature's allies that you are the creature who you appear to be. These benefits don't apply against the creature whose appearance you've taken on. The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you and another creature physically interact, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required).
