# Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to make it easy for you to distract and get away from foes. You can use the [[Hide]] maneuver even if you are observed and don't start in cover or concealment. If you do, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility. If you end this movement in cover or concealment, you are hidden.
