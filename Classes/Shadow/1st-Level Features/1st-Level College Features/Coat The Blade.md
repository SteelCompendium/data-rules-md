**Effect:** You coat one of your weapons with a harmful poison. The next creature you damage with an ability that uses that weapon takes \[SURGE\] poison damage. The poison loses its potency after you damage the creature or at the end of the encounter.

**Spend Insight:** For each insight you spend, add \[SURGE\] to the effect.
