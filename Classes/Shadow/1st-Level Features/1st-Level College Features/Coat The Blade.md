## Coat The Blade

Just a little poison goes a long way.

| **Keywords:** —    | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** You coat one of your weapons with a harmful poison. The next creature you damage with an ability that uses that weapon takes extra poison damage equal to twice your Presence score or the target is [[Weakened|weakened]] (EoT). You choose the effect when you apply the poison. The poison loses its potency after you damage the creature or at the end of the encounter.

**Spend [[Insight]]:** For each [[Insight|insight]] you spend, the damage dealt by the poison increases by a number equal to your Presence score. You can't spend more [[Insight]] than your [[Shadow|shadow]] level on this ability.
