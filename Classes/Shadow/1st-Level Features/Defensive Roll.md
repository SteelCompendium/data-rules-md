**Effect:** You halve the damage against the triggering damage, then can shift up to 2 squares after the triggering effect resolves. If you end this shift with concealment or cover, you can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed.

**Spend 1 Insight:** You reduce the potency of any effect associated with the damage for you by 1.
