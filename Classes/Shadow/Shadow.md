# Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge places you among the elite assassins, spies, and commandos. But more powerful than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemy's weakness.

As a shadow, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, let you move swiftly across the battlefield and away from hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the middle of the most heated combat encounter. You also possess more skills than any other hero.

## Basics

- **Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:
  - 2, −1, −1
  - 1, 1, −1
  - 1, 0, 0
- **Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18
- **Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 8
- **Recoveries:** 10
- **Skills:** [[Hide]] and Sneak, plus choose any five skills from [[Criminal]] Underworld or the skills of the exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue skill groups.

## 1st-level Features

As a shadow, you gain the following features.

### Shadow College

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You are one of the few who has graduated from a shadow college, chosen from the following options:

- **College of Black Ash:** The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to [[Teleport|teleport]] around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.
- **College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.
- **College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You gain the Lie skill.

Your choice of shadow college determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

### Insight

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them. You have a Heroic Resource called insight.

Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds, you have insight equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this insight outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.

When a combat encounter begins, you keep any insight you had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 insight. You gain 1 insight whenever you get a tier 3 result with an attack. When combat ends, you once again have insight equal to your Victories.

### 1st-level College Features

Your choice of college grants you one or two features, as shown on the 1st-Level Shadow College Features table.

#### 1st-level Shadow College Features

| College         | Feature                    |

You gain the following ability.

In a swirl of black ash, you step from one place to another.

|                     |                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------- |
| **Keywords:** Magic | **Type:** Action |
| **Distance:** Self  | **Target:** Self |

**Effect:** You [[Teleport|teleport]] up to 5 squares. If you end this movement in concealment or cover, you can use the [[Hide]] maneuver even if you are observed.

**Spend Insight:** You [[Teleport|teleport]] 1 additional square for each insight spent.

#### Coat The Blade

You gain the following ability.

##### Coat The Blade

Just a little poison goes a long way.

**Effect:** You coat one of your weapons with a harmful poison. The next creature you damage with an ability that uses that weapon takes extra poison damage equal to twice your Presence score or the target is [[Weakened|weakened]] (EoT). You choose the effect when you apply the poison. The poison loses its potency after you damage the creature or at the end of the encounter.

**Spend Insight:** For each insight you spend, the damage dealt by the poison increases by a number equal to your Presence score. You can't spend more Insight than your shadow level on this ability.

#### I'm On Your Side

You gain the following ability.

##### I'm On Your Side

Taking on the illusory countenance of another creature gives you an advantage on subterfuge.

**Effect:** Choose a creature of your size, whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours, and who is within 10 squares of you. Your body is covered in an illusion that makes you appear to be that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and changes your voice to sound like the creature. While this illusion lasts, you gain an edge on attacks against and Presence tests made to interact with the creature's allies, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from those allies. These benefits don't apply against the creature whose appearance you've taken on. The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you and another creature physically interact, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required).

#### Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to make it easy for you to distract and get away from foes. You can use the [[Hide]] maneuver even if you are observed and don't start in cover or concealment. If you do, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility. If you end this movement in cover or concealment, you are hidden.
