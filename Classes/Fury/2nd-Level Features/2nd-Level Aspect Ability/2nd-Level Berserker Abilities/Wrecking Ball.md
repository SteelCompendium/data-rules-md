# Wrecking Ball (5 Rage)

It is easier to destroy than to create. Much easier, in fact!

| **Distance:** Self                | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** You move up to your full speed in a straight line. You can move through mundane walls or other structures with each square counting as difficult terrain. Destroy each square of structure you move through and leave behind a square of difficult terrain. Make a power roll against every enemy you move past as part of this move.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **11 or lower:** push 1
- **12-16:** push 2
