# Animal Form

You have some of the noted benefits all the time, but gain other benefits only while in animal form, as noted on the table that tracks the benefits you gain from your [[Growing Rage]] feature for each [[Stormwight Kits|stormwight kit]].

The animal form feature for each [[Stormwight Kits|stormwight kit]] grants you the following ability:

## Animal Form

You take on the form of the animal who channels your [[Rage|rage]].

|                    |                    |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| **Keywords:** —    | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** You can shapeshift into the animal defined by your [[Stormwight Kits|stormwight kit]] or back into your true form. While in animal form, you can't use signature abilities or [[Heroic Abilities|heroic abilities]] unless they have the Animal keyword.

Additionally, you can both speak normally and speak to animals who share your form. If negotiation with an animal comes into play, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual while in your animal form.

**Spend 1 [[Rage]]:** As a free maneuver on your turn, you can shapeshift a second time, either into another animal form or back into your true form.
