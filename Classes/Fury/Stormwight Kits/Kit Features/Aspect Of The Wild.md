While in animal form or hybrid form, you can speak normally and can speak to animals who share your form. If you are in a negotiation with an animal, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual while in animal form.

**Spend 1 Rage:** As a free maneuver on your turn, you can shapeshift a second time, either into another animal form, into your hybrid form, or back into your true form.
