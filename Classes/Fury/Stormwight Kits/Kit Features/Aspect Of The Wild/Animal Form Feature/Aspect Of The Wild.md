# Aspect Of The Wild

You assume the form of the animal who channels your rage.

| **Keywords:** -    | **Type:** Maneuver |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self   |

**Effect:** You can shapeshift into the animal defined by your stormwight kit or back into your true form. While in animal form, you can't use signature abilities or heroic abilities unless they have the Animal keyword. Additionally, you can both speak normally and speak to animals who share your form. If negotiation with an animal comes into play, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual while in your animal form.

**Spend 1 Rage:** As a free maneuver on your turn, you can shapeshift a second time, either into another animal form or back into your true form.
