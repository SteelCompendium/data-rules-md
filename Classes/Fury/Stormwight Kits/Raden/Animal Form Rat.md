# Animal Form: Rat

When you are in your rat form, your movement gains the Climb keyword, and your size becomes 1T. You can use the [[Hide]] maneuver as a free maneuver, and you can use your allies as cover when hiding. You can stay hidden while moving through squares occupied by a creature.

Whenever your [[Rage|rage]] is 4 or higher, you can shapeshift to become a hybrid bipedal rat of your true form's size. You gain 10 temporary Stamina the first time you shapeshift into hybrid rat form during an encounter.
