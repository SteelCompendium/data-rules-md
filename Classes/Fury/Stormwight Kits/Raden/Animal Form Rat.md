# Animal Form: Rat

When you are in your rat form, your movement gains the Climb keyword, you become the size of a rat, 1T. You can use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver, and you can use your allies as cover when hiding. You can stay hidden while moving through squares occupied by a creature. Whenever your rage is 4 or higher, you can shapeshift to become a hybrid bipedal rat of your true form's size.
