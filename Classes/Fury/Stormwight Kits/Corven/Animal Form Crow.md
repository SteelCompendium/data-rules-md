# Animal Form: Crow

When you are in your crow form, your movement gains the Fly keyword, and your size becomes 1T. You can use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver, and you can use your allies as cover when you hide.

Whenever your rage is 4 or higher, you can shapeshift to become a hybrid bipedal crow of your true form's size. You gain 10 temporary Stamina the first time you shapeshift into hybrid crow form during an encounter.
