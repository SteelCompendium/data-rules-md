# Stormwight Kits

The [[Primordial Aspect|primordial aspect]] of the stormwight lets you channel your [[Rage|rage]] into the form of an animal and grants you knowledge of one of a number of special stormwight kits. You can master additional stormwight kits through play, swapping them out during a Respite as with any other kit. (See Kits.)
