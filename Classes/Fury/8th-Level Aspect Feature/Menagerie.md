# Menagerie

You gain access to all Stormwight kits and can choose to swap your kit during a respite and still take another respite activity. You now automatically sense the presence of any animal or elemental within 1 mile of you, even if they are hidden. Whenever you make a test to track another creature, you can roll three dice and choose which two to use.
