# Animal Form: Rat

When you are in your rat form, your size becomes 1T and your speed gains the Climb keyword. You can use the Hide maneuver as a free maneuver, and you can use your allies as cover when hiding. You can stay hidden while you move through any square occupied by a creature and gain an edge on tests made to climb other creatures.
