# Harbinger Of The Primordial Chaos

You can create a temporary source of elemental power as a Respite activity. This source of elemental power will last 24 hours after creation.

If you use your Herald of Primordial Chaos ability to create a portal to the Primordial Chaos, the source of elemental power lasts as long as the portal is maintained in your network.
