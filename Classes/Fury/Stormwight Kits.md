# Stormwight Kits

The primordial aspect of the stormwight lets you channel your rage into the form of an animal, and grants you knowledge of one of a number of special stormwight kits. You can master additional stormwight kits through play,

changing them out during a Respite as with any other kit. (See Kits.)
