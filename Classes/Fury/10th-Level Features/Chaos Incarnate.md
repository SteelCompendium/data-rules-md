# Chaos Incarnate

As your rage grows you begin to manifest elemental power, taking on aspects of various elemental forces.

You now gain damage immunity (acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, and sonic) equal to twice your Might score. If you are a stormwight, your damage immunity from your Primordial Storm increases to triple your Might score instead.

If you enter combat with an elemental or any creature with abilities that deals acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage, they begin the combat **P \< \[strong\]** frightened of you (save ends).

When you use Primordial Strike, you can spend up to 3 rage, gaining 1 surge per rage spent to use on the strike.
