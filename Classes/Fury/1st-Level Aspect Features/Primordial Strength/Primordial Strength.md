# Primordial Strength

Whenever you damage an object with a weapon strike, it takes additional damage equal to your Might score. Additionally, whenever you push another creature into an object, they take additional damage equal to your Might score.

As your rage grows, your primordial strength intensifies, granting benefits from the Primordial Strength Growing Rage table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.
