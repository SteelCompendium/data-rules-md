**Effect:** You move up to your speed in a straight line, and you don't treat enemy squares as difficult terrain for this move. You can end this move in a creature's space and then move them to an adjacent unoccupied space. You make one power roll that targets each enemy whose space you move through.

Power Roll + Might: - *11 or lower:* **2 damage** - *12-16:* **3 damage** - *17+:* **5 damage**

The last target you damage takes extra damage equal to your Might score for every free strike you triggered during your move.
