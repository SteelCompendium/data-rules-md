# Elemental Form

Your Rage exhibits more signs of the elemental forces from the Primordial Chaos. When you show strong emotion or grow your Rage, elemental motes attuned to your mood flit around you and your skin changes its appearance to reflect various elements. You gain damage immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, and sonic damage equal to your Might score. If you are a stormwight, your damage immunity from your Primordial Storm increases to twice your Might score instead.
