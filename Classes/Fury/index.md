# Fury

You do not temper the heat of battle within you, you unleash it! Like a raptor, a [[Panther|panther]], a wolf, your experience in the wild taught you the secret of channeling unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial chaos is your ally. Leave it to others to use finesse to clean up the pieces you leave behind.

As a [[Fury|fury]], you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, move you around the battlefield, and grow in strength as your [[Rage|rage]] increases. Nature has no concept of fairnessâ€”and neither do you.
