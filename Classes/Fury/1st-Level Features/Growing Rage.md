# Growing Rage

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of [[Rage|rage]] you have. See Aspect Features for details. The benefits from your growing [[Rage|rage]] last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of [[Rage|rage]] you spend during your turn.
