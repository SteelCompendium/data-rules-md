**Trigger:** You are targeted by a damaging area of effect.

**Effect:** You shift up to 2 squares. If that moves you out of the area of effect, you ignore the attack. Otherwise, you take half damage.

**Spend 3 Rage:** You move a willing adjacent ally affected by the attack with you, applying the same outcome to them.
