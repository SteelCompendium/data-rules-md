**Effect:** You move up to your speed in a straight line, and you don't treat enemy squares as difficult terrain for this move. You can end this move in a creature's space and then move them to an adjacent unoccupied space. You make one power roll that targets each enemy whose space you move through.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 damage**
- *12-16:* **3 damage**
- *17+:* **5 damage**

The last target you damage takes extra damage equal to your Might score for every free strike you triggered during your move.

YOUR ENTRAILS ARE YOUR EXTRAILS!(3 RAGE)

*Hard for them to fight when they're busy holding in their giblets.*

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **3 + M damage;** M \< weak, **bleeding (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **5 + M damage;** M \< average\*\*, bleeding (save ends)\*\*
- *17+:* **8 + M damage;** M \< strong\*\*, bleeding (save ends)\*\*

**Effect:** While bleeding, the target takes damage equal to your Might score at the end of your turns.
