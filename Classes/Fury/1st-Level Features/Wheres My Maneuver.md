# Where's My Maneuver?

Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, during playtesting many folks asked, “Where is the fury's special maneuver?” The fury doesn't need a maneuver all their own because most of the time we've found that the fantasy of the fury has them using the **Knockback** or **Grab** maneuvers in combat. They're really good at it too, so it doesn't make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.
