# Rage

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

## Rage In Combat

When a combat encounter begins, you gain rage equal to your Victories. At the start of each turn of combat, you gain 1d3 rage. The first time in a round that you take damage, you gain 1 rage. Your rage disappears at the end of the encounter.

## Rage Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain rage outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost rage without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs rage outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited rage on its effect, such as *To the Uttermost End*, out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of rage on it equal to your Victories.
