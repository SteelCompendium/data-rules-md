# Marauder Of The Primordial Chaos

You can sense any elementals or sources of elemental power within 1 mile of you. You can speak with elementals. You are considered to have 1 higher Renown if negotiation with an elemental comes into play.

If you enter combat with an elemental they begin the combat **P \< \[average\]** frightened of you (save ends).

As an action you can touch a source of elemental power and use it to create a portal to the Primordial Chaos. You can use an action to teleport yourself and any willing

creatures within 10 squares of you through the portal onto a safe island the Primordial Chaos or back again. You can maintain a number of portals equal to your Might score, each leading to the safe island in the Primordial Chaos. If a portal in your network is destroyed, it is no longer part of the network. You can remove a portal from your network no matter your distance from it, including interplanar (no action required).

You can choose to explore the Primordial Chaos from your safe island, but safety is not guaranteed.
