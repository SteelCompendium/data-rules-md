| **Distance:** 3 Aura | **Target:** All creatures |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you become dying, enemies in the aura take damage of your primordial storm type equal to twice your Might score at the end of your turn.

Your speed gains the Flying keyword while the aura is active. Any allies that begin or end their turn in your aura also gain the flying keyword to their speed until the start of their next turn or the aura ends.

**Spend No Rage:** You can use this ability without spending rage outside of combat. If you do, you must spend 1 uninterrupted minute summoning a primordial storm and take 1d6 damage before its effects occur. The storm lasts for 1 hour or until a combat encounter begins.
