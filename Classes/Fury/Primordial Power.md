# Primordial Power

You gain an epic resource called primordial power. When you take a Respite, you gain primordial power equal to the XP you gain. As a free triggered action, you can spend primordial power to become rage until the end of an encounter.

Additionally, you can spend primordial power as a free maneuver to remove a condition or effect on you. You remove 1 condition or effect for each primordial power spent.

You can spend 3 primordial power to create a portal to the Primordial Chaos without needing a source of elemental power.

Primordial power remains until you spend it.
