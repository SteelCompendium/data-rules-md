# To Stone!(9 Rage)

*You channel the Primordial Chaos into blows that petrify your foe, literally.*

| **Distance:**                                                                                            | **Target:** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **9 + M damage; M \< \[weak\] slowed (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **13 + M damage; M \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)**
- *17+:* **18 + M damage; M \< \[strong\] restrained (save ends)**

**Effect:** While the target is slowed, any additional abilities with a slowed effect instead turn this slowed condition to restrained. A creature who fails their save while restrained this way becomes petrified. Petrification remains until a magical cure is applied or until you choose to reverse the effect (no action required).
