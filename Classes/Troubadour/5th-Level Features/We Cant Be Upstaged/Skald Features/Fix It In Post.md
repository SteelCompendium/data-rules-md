# Fix It In Post

You can use a free maneuver on your turn to change one of the conditions of a creature within range of your Dramatic Monologue ability. Select one of the following conditions that the target has: bleeding, frightened, prone, slowed, or taunted. The target's condition changes to another condition on the list, maintaining the same duration and origin of condition that they had previously. If a target is no longer prone, they stand up.
