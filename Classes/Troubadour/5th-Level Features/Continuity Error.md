**Effect:** The target is split into two separate entities, each with half of the original target's Stamina. The second entity appears in an unoccupied space within distance. Each entity is weakened and takes 1d6 corruption damage at the start of each of their turns until one of them is reduced to 0 Stamina or all entities occupy the same space and automatically merge, ending all effects of this ability on them.
