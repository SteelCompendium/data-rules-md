# Hear Ye, Hear Ye!

You can spread one piece of information onto the winds via bragging, intimidating, leading, or lying. Make a Presence test:

- *11 or lower:* Your message reaches no one.
- *12-16:* Your message reaches the nearby town (or townsized civilization). You and allied heroes present for your test have an edge on all Presence tests in the affected area until one of you spends a Recovery.
- *17+:* Your message reaches the nearby town and the next town over. You and allied heroes present for your test have an edge on all Presence tests in the affected areas until you start your next respite.
