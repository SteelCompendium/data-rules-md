# Melodrama

You have more ways of getting the most drama out of a situation. Add two of the following events to your list of events that grant you drama during battle:

- **1 Drama:** A creature rolls a natural 2.
- **2 Drama:** The first time the Director deals damage to a hero using Malice or a Villain Action.
- **2 Drama:** The first time a hero unwillingly falls 5 or more squares.
- **2 Drama:** The first time a hero deals damage with three surges
- **2 Drama:** A hero uses their last Recovery.
- Instead of another event, increase the drama gained from an event on your list by 1.
