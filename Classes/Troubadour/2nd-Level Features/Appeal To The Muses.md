# Appeal To The Muses

You can give a rousing speech, invoke your inspirations, or lift your fellows' spirits to heighten the drama of your present circumstances. However, irony is eager to hand your fortune to the villain and achieve the same ends.

When you roll to gain drama, you can make your appeal and gain the additional effects (no action required):

- If your drama roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama, but the Director also gains 1 Malice.
- If your drama roll is a 2, you gain 1 Heroic Resource which you can keep or give to an ally within distance of your active routine. The Director also gains 1 Malice.
- If your drama roll is a 3, you gain 2 Heroic Resources, which you can distribute amongst yourself and any allies within distance of your active routine.
