| **Keywords:** Area, Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** 3 Cube within 10    | **Target:** Special |

- **Effect:** The affected area becomes haunted by a swirling horde of phantoms brutally dancing in a circle until the end of the encounter. An ally can enter a square of the area without spending movement. At the start of each of your turns, or once per round as a free triggered action whenever an enemy enters the area, you can target all enemies occupying a square of the area with the following power roll.

**Power Roll + Presence:** - 11 or lower: 5 corruption damage; M \[weak\] pull 1 towards center of square - 12-16: 9 corruption damage; M \[average\] pull 1 towards center of square and can't establish line of effect outside of affected area (EoT) - 17+: 12 corruption damage; M \[strong\] pull 3 towards center of square and can't establish line of effect outside of affected area (EoT)
