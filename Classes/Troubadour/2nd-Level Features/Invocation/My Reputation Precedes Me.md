# My Reputation Precedes Me

You can choose to invoke your reputation at the start of a social interaction with a community that hasn't met you before, automatically creating a bond with a representative NPC as if using your Scene Partner feature. While the bond is active, all present heroes are treated as having 2 higher Renown for the purposes of negotiations and influencing tests with the community.

The Director may choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond and make you infamous with the community instead. All present heroes have a bane on interpersonal skill tests with the community until actions are taken to improve your reputations. You can still use your Scene Partner feature to find allies within the community.
