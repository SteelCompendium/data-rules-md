# Formal Introductions

As a respite activity, you can scribe a notice of your arrival, such as a calling card or a formal letter, addressed to an enemy and have it delivered. You can choose to deliver it to the target personally, via a courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can only have one notice active at a time.

It is up to the Director when the target receives the notice. Once the target receives your notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you. The Director gains 1 additional Malice per round during future encounters involving the target. You and your allies start these encounters with 2 additional hero tokens. These hero tokens disappear at the end of the encounter.
