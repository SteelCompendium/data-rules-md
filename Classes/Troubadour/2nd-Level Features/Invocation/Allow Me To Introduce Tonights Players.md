# Allow Me To Introduce Tonight's Players

When you take the first turn in a combat encounter, you can use your action to introduce you and your allies to your opponents. All creatures on your side can shift up to their speed and have the benefit of the Defend action until the end of the round. Any enemies that were surprised are no longer surprised.
