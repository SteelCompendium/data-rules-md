# Blocking

You have access to the following routine to use with Curtain Call.

## Blocking

*No, no, no, you lose the audience that way. Try it like this â€¦*

|                           |                     |
| :------------------------ | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Area, Magic | **Type:** Routine   |
| **Distance:** 2 aura      | **Target:** Special |

- **Effect:** At the end of each round, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your Presence score within the aura to be teleported to different, unoccupied squares within the aura. Targets can't be moved into places where they would immediately get hurt, such as over a cliffside or on a bed of spikes, nor can they be moved in a way that would result in them suffering a condition, such as grappled or restrained, or other harmful effect.
