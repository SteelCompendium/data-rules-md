**Effect:** At the end of each of your turns while this routine is active, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your Presence score in the aura, causing those creatures to be teleported to unoccupied squares in the aura. A target can't be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect.
