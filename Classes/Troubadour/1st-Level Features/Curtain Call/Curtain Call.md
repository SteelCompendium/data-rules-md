# Curtain Call

You enter every performance with a set of routines at the ready. Routines are auras and other wide-reaching effects that center around you while you take action. At the start of each round of combat and at the start of each of your turns, while you are not dazed, dead, or surprised, you can either set a new routine to be active or maintain your current routine. Your routine ends when you are unable to make this choice or at the end of the encounter.

You have access to the following **Choreography** routine. Your Class Act determines any additional routines you can select from.
