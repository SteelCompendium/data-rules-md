# Scene Partner

When you use an interpersonal skill on a test while interacting with an NPC like a bystander or a rival without failing, you can choose to form a bond with them. During negotiations with this NPC, their patience increases by 1 and compelling arguments you personally make to the NPC that would increase their interest by 1 instead increase their interest by 2. You can have a number of bonds active equal to your level, losing a bond of your choice whenever you make a new bond beyond your limit.
