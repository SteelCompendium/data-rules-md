- **Effect:** You turn invisible and create a magical illusion of your corpse falling in your square. While invisible, your speed increases by 3 and you ignore difficult terrain. The illusion melts into the ground and your invisibility ends if the illusion is interacted with, you take damage, you perform an action or a maneuver, or at the end of your next turn.
