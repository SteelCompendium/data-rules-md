# Drama

You are fueled by the dynamic ups, downs, and upside downs of battle. You have a Heroic Resource called drama.

## Drama In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain drama equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 drama.

You gain additional drama whenever any of the following events occur during battle:

- A creature within your line of effect rolls a natural 19 or 20: 3 drama
- The first time three or more heroes use an ability on the same turn: 2 drama
- The first time a hero becomes winded: 2 drama
- A hero, including you, dies: 10 drama

You still gain drama during combat while you are dead and your body is intact. During the encounter you died in, if you have 30 drama accrued, you can choose to come back to life with 1 Stamina and 0 drama as no action. You can't gain drama in future encounters while you remain dead.

Your drama disappears at the end of the encounter.

## Drama Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain drama outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost drama without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs drama outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.
