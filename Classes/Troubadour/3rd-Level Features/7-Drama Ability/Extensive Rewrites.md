*No this isn't right. That foe was over there!*

| **Keywords:** Area, Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver      |
| **Distance:** 4 Burst             | **Target:** All enemies |

**Power Roll + Presence:** - **11 or lower:** slide 3; P \[weak\] forced movement ignores stability - **12-16:** slide 5; P \[average\] forced movement ignores stability - **17+:** slide 7; P \[strong\] forced movement ignores stability

**Effect:** You can't slide targets into other creatures or objects using this ability. Instead of sliding a target, you can choose to swap their location with another target (provided each target can fit into the new space).
