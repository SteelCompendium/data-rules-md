# We Meet At Last, Let's Finish This (7 Drama)

*Totus mundus agit histrionem.*

| **Keywords:** —              | **Type:** Maneuver     |
| **Distance:** Line of effect | **Target:** 1 creature |

- **Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, both you and the target can target each other with abilities even if you would be out of distance. Secondary effects that grapple or force move the target don't happen if you aren't within the distance of the ability. On each of your turns, you can take a free maneuver to communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either giving them \[SURGE\]\[SURGE\] or a bane on the next attack they use before the start of your next turn.
