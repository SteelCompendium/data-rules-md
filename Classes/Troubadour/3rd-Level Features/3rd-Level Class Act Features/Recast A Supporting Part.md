# Recast A Supporting Part

If you aren't surprised at the beginning of an encounter, you can choose one enemy within line of effect who isn't a leader or a solo creature. The director swaps that creature out with a squad of minions whose encounter value doesn't exceed the chosen creature's encounter value. The Director can determine that this feature can't be used against certain special enemies.
