# Recast A Supporting Part

If you aren't surprised at the beginning of an encounter, you can choose one non-boss or non-solo enemy within line of effect and have the director swap them out with a squad of minions that doesn't exceed the enemy's encounter value. This can't be used against an enemy directly associated with a special objective.
