| **Keywords:** Area, Magic | **Type:** Routine               |
| **Distance:** 5 Aura      | **Target:** Self and all allies |

- **Effect:** While this routine is active, each target that starts their turn within the aura doesn't suffer a bane when targeting concealed enemies. They can also search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver once during their turn.
