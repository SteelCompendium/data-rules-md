| **Distance:**                                                                                                 | **Target:** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- *11 or lower:* **Slide 3;** P \< weak\*\*, this slide ignores the target's stability.\*\*
- *12-16:* **Slide 5;** P \< average\*\*, this slide ignores the target's stability.\*\*
- *17+:* **Slide 7;** P \< strong\*\*, this slide ignores the target's stability.\*\*

**Effect:** Instead of sliding a target, you can swap their location with another target as long as each can fit into the other's space. You can't slide targets into other creatures or objects using this ability.
