# Auteur

When you gain drama at the start of your turn, you gain 1d3 + 1 drama. If you make an appeal to the muses, use the following results from now on:

- If your drama roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional drama, but the Director also gains 2 Malice.
- If your drama roll is a 2, 3, 4, or 5, you gain 1 Heroic Resource which you can keep or give to an ally within distance of your active routine. The Director also gains 1 Malice.
- If your drama roll is a 6, you gain 4 Heroic Resources, which you can distribute amongst yourself and any allies within distance of your active routine. A recipient can only receive up to maximum of 2 Heroic Resources this way.
