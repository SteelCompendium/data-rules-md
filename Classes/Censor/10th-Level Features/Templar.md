# Templar

You are now the ultimate representation of your god's justice in the timescape. When you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity 3 questions, which the Director must answer honestly (though they may answer cryptically and not completely) if your deity knows the answer to the questions. Additionally, you can emerge from your respite in any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.

Your god will also give you a priority target to enact justice on. You are your allies have a double edge on all power rolls against the priority target. If you attempt to open a portal to your deity before you have defeated the priority target, you will suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director.

Whenever you use the Judgment maneuver you can use a Conduit Domain Effect as a free triggered action, including an effect from a domain you access with Ardor.
