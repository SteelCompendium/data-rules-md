# Virtue

You gain an epic resource called virtue. When you take a Respite, you gain virtue equal to the XP you gain. You can spend Virtue as if it were wrath on abilities you have.

You can spend 3 virtue to gain access to a single domain from your deity that you normally don't have access to. You have access to that domain's abilities until your next Respite.

Virtue remains until you spend it.
