# Judgement In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain judgement equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 judgement. The first time in a round that a creature judged by you deals damage to another creature, you generate and bank 1 judgment on them. When combat ends, you lose all your judgement.

Abilities that target a judged creature can only target a creature with at least 1 judgment banked on them.
