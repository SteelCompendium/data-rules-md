# Judgement Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain judgment outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost judgment without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs judgment outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.
