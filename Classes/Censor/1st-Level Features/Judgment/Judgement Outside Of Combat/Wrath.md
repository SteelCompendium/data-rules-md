# Wrath

**Fear my wrath!**

|                             |                     |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged | **Type:** Maneuver  |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10     | **Target:** 1 enemy |

**Effect:** You bank 1 or more judgment on the target. While a creature has at least 1 judgment on it, any targets they attack gain `ðŸ›¡`.

Each judgment banked on the judged creature increases the effectiveness of your censor abilities, indicated on your order's judgment type table below. A creature stays judged until the end of the encounter while they have any judgment on them.

When using a heroic ability that targets a creature with judgment banked, you can spend banked judgment on that creature to use the ability.

When the judged creature is reduced to 0 Stamina or otherwise removes the judgment, you can use a free triggered action to take the judgment banked on the judged creature and move it to a new target within distance. Any judgment you do not bank on this new target is returned to you.

When you bank judgment on a creature, you also gain one of the following benefits based on your order:

- **Exorcist:** You teleport a distance equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged target. You do not need line of effect for this movement.
- **Oracle:** You deal `âš¡` holy damage to the target and each enemy within 2 squares of the target.
- **Paragon:** You pull the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.
