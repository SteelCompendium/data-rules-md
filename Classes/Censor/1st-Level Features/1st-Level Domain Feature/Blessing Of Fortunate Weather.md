# Blessing Of Fortunate Weather

When you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions within 100 squares of you. If you are in the same area as another conduit or creature using this or a similar feature, your overlapping areas cancel each other.

Those weather conditions follow you through any mundane outdoors locations where you travel until the end of your next respite. Choose one of the following types of weather:

- **Clear:** You and your allies each gain an edge on tests that use the Search or Navigate skills.
- **Foggy:** You and your allies each gain an edge on tests that use the Hide skill.
- **Overcast:** You and your allies each gain an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.
- **Precipitation:** When the ground is muddy or snowy, you and your allies each gain an edge on tests that use the Track skill.
