# Oracular Visions

Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of Fate points. When you or a creature within 10 squares of you makes a test, you can spend 1 Fate point to allow your god to share a vision of the outcome of the test with the creature making it, allowing them to adjust their plan for better success. The creature gets an edge on the test. You lose all your Fate points when you finish a respite.
