# Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or another character who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. When you perform the ritual, the target's recovery value increases by an amount equal to your level. This benefit lasts until you complete another respite.
