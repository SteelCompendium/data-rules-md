# Saint's Vigilance

You have honed your ability to detect sin and can use it to find those who hide from justice. Any creature judged by you cannot take the Hide maneuver. You have an edge when searching for hidden creatures and, if you find a hidden creature, you can use Judgment on them as a free triggered action.
