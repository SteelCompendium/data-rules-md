# Your Allies Turn On You! (11 Wrath)

*You turn your enemy's ire to the target.*

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- *11 or lower:* **5 + P damage; I \< \[weak\] slowed (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **9 + P damage; I \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)**
- *17+:* **12 + P damage; I \< \[strong\] slowed (save ends)**

**Effect:** While the target is slowed, their allies within 5 squares of them must make a free strike against the target once as a free maneuver at the beginning of their turns. In addition, while the target is slowed, any allies within 5 of the target must retarget any triggered free strikes to the target instead.
