- Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina that lasts until the end of their next respite if it doesn't disappear through damage first.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.
- Each creature has an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.
