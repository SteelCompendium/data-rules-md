# Minor Miracle

You can beseech the gods to restore a fallen ally to life. To do so, you must have at least half of the creature's remains and they must have died an untimely death from something that isn't age-related within the last **24 hours**.

As a respite activity, you perform a religious ritual to return the creature to life. The creature's soul must be willing to return to life for the ritual to work, and you know if they are or not the moment before you begin the respite activity. If the creature's soul is willing and able, they return to life at the end of the respite with full Stamina and half their Recoveries. Additionally, you only gain Recoveries equal to half your maximum at the end of the respite.
