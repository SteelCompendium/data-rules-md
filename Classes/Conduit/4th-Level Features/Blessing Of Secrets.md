You gain the following ability.

BLESSING OF SECRETS

*You project an illusory aura that makes you and allies harder to notice.*

| Keywords: Magic           | Type: Maneuver              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Distance: Self and 3 aura | Target: Self and all allies |

**Effect:** Each creature in the aura has a double edge on tests made to hide and sneak. The aura lasts until you end it (no action required), or a creature affected by it harms or deals damage to an object or another creature.
