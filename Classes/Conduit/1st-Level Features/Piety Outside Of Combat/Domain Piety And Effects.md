# Domain Piety And Effects

Your choice of domains provides you with extra ways that you can earn piety during combat. These ways of gaining piety are triggered by events that happen during combat. There is a chance that you could have a single event trigger both of your piety effects. For example, if you are a 1st-level conduit and have the Sun domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes fire damage, and the War domain, which grants piety whenever a nearby creature takes 11 or more damage, and a nearby creature takes 12 fire damage, you would gain piety from both domains for that one effect.

Additionally, whenever you activate a domain effect by praying for piety, choose one of your domains. That domain's effect takes effect immediately.
