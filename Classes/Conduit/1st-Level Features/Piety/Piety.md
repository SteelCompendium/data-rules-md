# Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety to fuel your abilities. You use piety to heal and empower your allies, and to unleash your deity's power upon your foes.

## Piety In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods when you roll to gain piety, but beware. Praying to the gods can easily draw their ire! They hate to be annoyed. When you roll to gain piety, you can pray to the gods and gain the additional effects (no action required):

- If your piety roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take 1d6 + your level psychic damage, which can't be reduced in any way.
- If your piety roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.
- If your piety roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and you can activate a domain effect of your choice.

Your piety disappears at the end of the encounter.

## Piety Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs piety outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, out of combat, you can use itâ€¦

it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.
