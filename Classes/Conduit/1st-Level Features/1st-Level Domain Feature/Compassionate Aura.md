# Compassionate Aura

You exude a magic aura that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test. Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, the NPC's patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.
