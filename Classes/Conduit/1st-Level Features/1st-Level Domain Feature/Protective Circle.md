# Protective Circle

You can spend **10 minutes** working while uninterrupted to create a protective circle on the ground around a **size 1 area** of land. The circle lasts for **24 hours** or until you dismiss it (no action) and only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter or exit the area.
