# Faithful Friend

As an action, you conjure an animal spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal can't physically interact with the world, but they have a speed of **5 (fly)**. While you are within **10 squares** of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their form could sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit takes any damage, it is dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage\*\*, which can't be reduced in any way.
