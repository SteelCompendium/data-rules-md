# Inner Light

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or another character who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the target's soul, granting the target an edge on resistance rolls. This benefit lasts until you complete another respite.
