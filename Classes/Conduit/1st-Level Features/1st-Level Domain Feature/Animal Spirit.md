# Animal Spirit

As an action, you conjure an animal spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal can't physically interact with the world, but they have a speed of 5 (fly) and can move through mundane objects. While you are within 20 squares of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their form could sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required).
