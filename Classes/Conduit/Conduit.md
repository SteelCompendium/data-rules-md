# Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

As a conduit, you heal and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting you increased empathy.

## Conduit Ward

Your god gives you a ward that protects you. Choose one of the following wards. You can change your ward along with

your prayer (see Prayer) by praying to your god as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Bastion Ward)

#### Bastion Ward

You god grants you a holy countenance that protects you at all times. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

#### Quickness Ward

The gods imbue a divine swiftness within you. Whenever an adjacent creature deals damage to you, you can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score after the damage is dealt.

#### Sanctuary Ward

In response to a foe's aggression, the gods protect you. After another creature damages you, that creature can't target you with a strike until you harm them or one of their allies, or until the end of their next turn.

### Spirit Ward

Invisible spirits surround you if you are harmed. Whenever an adjacent creature deals damage to you, they take corruption damage equal to your Intuition score.
