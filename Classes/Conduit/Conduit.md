# Conduit

The power of the gods flows through you! As a vessel for divine magic, you don't just keep your allies in the fight. You make those allies more effective, even as you rain divine energy down upon your foes. While the deity or saint you serve might have other faithful and clergy, you are special among worshippers, receiving your abilities from the highest source.

As a conduit, you [[Heal\|heal]] and buff your allies, and debuff your foes while smiting them with divine magic. The spark of divinity within you shines, aweing your enemies and granting you increased empathy.

## Basics

- **Starting Characteristics**: You start with an Intuition of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:
  - 2, −1, −1
  - 1, 1, −1
  - 1, 0, 0
- **Starting Stamina at 1st Level**: 18
- **Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels**: 8
- **Recoveries**: 10
- **Skills**: Choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups.

## 1st-level Features

As a conduit, you gain the following features.

### Deity And Domains

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Conduit Deities table, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director's permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you'll gain from this class.

(Playtest note: More gods and saints are coming, along with their descriptions.)

#### Conduit Deities

| Deity   | Domains                         |

### Piety

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety to fuel your abilities. You use piety to [[Heal\|heal]] and empower your allies, and to unleash your deity's power upon your foes.

Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds, you have piety equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this piety outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.

When a combat encounter begins, you keep any piety you had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 piety. You can also use the Prayer ability to gain additional piety. When combat ends, you once again have piety equal to your Victories.

#### Prayer

*I beseech you!*

As an action, you conjure an animal spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The incorporeal animal can't physically interact with the world, but they have a speed of 5 ([[Fly\|fly]]) and can move through mundane objects. While you are within 20 squares of the spirit, you can sense everything an animal of their form could sense, in addition to sensing your own surroundings. You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required).

#### Compassionate Aura

You exude a magic aura that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.

When you finish a respite, you can decide the weather conditions in the local area. Those weather conditions follow you through any mundane outdoors locations where you travel until the end of your next respite. Choose one of the following types of weather:

#### Divine Thievery

The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Intuition on the test instead of another characteristic.

#### Fate Trance

If you spend 10 minutes in an uninterrupted meditative state without moving, you get a glimpse of any significant events that will happen in the area around you in the next 24 hours unless you or your allies intercede in those events. As described by the Director, these glimpses of the future might be clear and concise, or might be vague and hard to understand.

#### Grave Speech

You gain the following ability.

##### Grave Speech

The power of death lets you speak with those who have passed from the world.

**Effect**: You can speak to the corpse or head of a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability on the same creature twice.

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or another character who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. As you perform the ritual, you place a ray of morning light into the target's soul, granting the target an edge on resistance rolls. This benefit lasts until you complete another respite.

#### Revitalizing Ritual

Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or another character who is also ending a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. When you perform the ritual, the target's recovery value increases by an amount equal to your level. This benefit lasts until you complete another respite.
