# Divine Power

You gain an epic resource called divine power. When you take a respite, you gain divine power equal to the XP you gain. You can spend divine power as if it were piety on abilities you have.

Additionally, you can spend divine power as if it were piety to use any conduit abilities you don't have, since the gods

can answer your prayers with temporary and unique gifts. If you use a conduit ability you don't have that normally costs no piety, you must spend 1 divine power to use it.

Divine power remains until you spend it.
