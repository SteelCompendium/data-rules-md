You are now an avatar of your god! When you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity 3 questions, which the Director must answer honestly (though they may answer cryptically and not completely) if your deity knows the answer to the questions. Additionally, you can emerge from your respite in any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.

Additionally, you can be affected by up to three prayers at once. You can change all of these prayers and your ward as a respite activity.

You can also use a maneuver to activate one of your domain effects without needing to pray.
