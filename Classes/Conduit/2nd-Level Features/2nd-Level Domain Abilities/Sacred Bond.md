| **Distance:** Self or Ranged 10 | **Target:** 2 allies, including self |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, whenever one target takes damage, the other can choose to take it instead as a free triggered action. The original target still suffers any effects associated with the damage. Additionally, whenever one target spends a Recovery, the other can also spend a Recovery as a free triggered action.
