**Effect:** Before the target dies, you can look at their stat block and use one ability that is an action or maneuver. If the action normally costs a heroic resource or Malice, they can still use it without any cost. For the purposes of this ability, your allies and enemies are the target's allies and enemies, and you decide who their ability targets.
