| **Distance:** 5 aura **Target:** All enemies                                                             | **Target:** |

**Effect:** The target is blessed by fate until the end of the encounter or until you are dying. All tier 1 results on power rolls they make become tier 2 results and all tier 2 results become tier 3 results while blessed this way.

BLESSING OF THE FORTRESS (11 PIETY)

*A magic circle extends out from you, barring foes from getting close.*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or you are dying, each target can't enter the aura by moving or by being force moved by one of your enemies. Targets can be forced moved into the aura by your or your allies or be moved into the area because of your movement.

DIVINE DRAGON (11 PIETY)

*From nothing but divine will, you create a powerful ally.*

**Effect:** A size 4 dragon appears within range. The dragon has a speed of 6 (fly), stability of 4, a Stamina of 100, fire immunity, and uses your characteristics. The dragon disappears at the end of the encounter, if their Stamina drops to 0, or if you start dying.

On your turn, you can use your action to command the dragon to breath magic fire in a 3 cube within 1 square of them and make the following power roll targeting enemies in the area.

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- *11 or lower:* 5 **fire damage**
- *12-16:* 9 **fire damage**
- *17+:* 12 **fire damage**

You can use your maneuver to make the dragon move up to their speed or use the following melee weapon strike with their claw against an adjacent creature or object, which also serves as a free strike the dragon can use:

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- *11 or lower:* **3 + I damage**
- *12-16:* 5 + I **damage**
- *17+:* 8 + I **damage**

GODSTORM (11 PIETY)

*You summon a divine storm that remains under your control.*

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- *11 or lower:* 2 **lightning damage; 2 sonic damage**
- *12-16:* 3 **lightning damage; 3 sonic damage**
- *17+:* 5 **lightning damage; 5 sonic damage**

**Effect:** A raging storm remains in the area until the end of the encounter or you are dying. At the start of your turn, you can move the storm 5 squares. On subsequent turns while the storm is active, you can use a maneuver to remake its power roll.
