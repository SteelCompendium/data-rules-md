**Effect:** Each target is marked by you. You immediately force each targeted creature to make a free strike against a creature of your choice within 5 squares of the targeted creature.

TRY ME INSTEAD (5 FOCUS)

*"Try picking on someone MY size."*

**Effect:** You shift your speed directly toward an ally adjacent to the target, then swap locations with the ally as long as you can each fit into the other's space. The ally can spend a Recovery, and you make a power roll against the target.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 + R damage; R** \< weak\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*
- *12-16:* **3 + R damage; R** \< average\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*
- *17+:* **4 + R damage; R** \< strong\*\*, frightened (save ends)\*\*
