# Fog Of War (5 Focus)

Your unorthodox strategy causes enemies to lash out in fear, heedless of who they may be attacking.

| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Maneuver          |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** Up to 3 enemies |

**Effect:** Mark each of the targets until the beginning of your next turn. You can choose to bank extra focus on these targets as part of this ability. Until the beginning of your next turn, whenever you or an ally makes an attack against any marked target, you can force the marked target to make a free strike against a creature within 5.
