“Try picking on someone MY size.”

| **Keywords:** Attack, Melee, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 1               | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** You shift your speed directly toward an ally adjacent to the target and then swap locations with the ally, provided you can fit into each other's spaces. The ally can spend a Recovery and you roll power against the target.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 11 or lower: 2 damage; R \[weak\] frightened of you (save ends)
- 12–16: 3 damage; R \[average\] frightened of you (save ends)
- 17+: 4 damage; R \[strong\] frightened of you (save ends)
