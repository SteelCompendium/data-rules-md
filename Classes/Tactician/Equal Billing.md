# Equal Billing

You can now use your Scene Partner feature to form a bond with a willing fellow hero in addition to NPCs. If you bond with a second hero, you lose your bond with the previous hero.

You and creatures who are bonded to you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. If you or a bonded creature succeeds on a saving throw, you both get temporary Stamina equal to your level.
