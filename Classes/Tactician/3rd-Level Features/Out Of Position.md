# Out Of Position

You are prepared for all eventualities. At the beginning of the encounter, before any creatures take their turn, you can use Mark as a free triggered action. You can immediately slide the marked creature 3 squares. This movement ignores Stability but cannot move into squares that would cause damage or death.

This feature works even if you are surprised.
