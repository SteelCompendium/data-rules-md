WE MEET AT LAST. LET'S FINISH THIS (7 DRAMA)

*Totus mundus agit histrionem.*

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, both you and the target can target each other with abilities even if you are beyond distance, with the distance of this ability replacing those abilities' distances. Abilities that grapple or force move a target are ignored if the target isn't within the distance of the ability.

Additionally, on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either giving them two surges or a bane on the next attack they use before the start of your next turn.
