# Warmaster

You have mastered the entirety of possible strategies and tactics. Whenever you or an ally makes an ability power roll against a target marked by you, they can roll three dice and choose which two to use. Allies spend 2 fewer Heroic Resources (minimum 1) to use heroic abilities that include at least one marked target as a target.
