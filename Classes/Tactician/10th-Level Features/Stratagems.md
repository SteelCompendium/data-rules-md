# Stratagems

You gain an epic resource called stratagem. When you take a Respite, you gain stratagems equal to the XP you gain. You can spend stratagems as if it were focus on abilities you have.

Whenever you or an ally damages a marked target you can spend 1 stratagem to increase the result for the target by one tier, as a free triggered action. Whenever an enemy marked by you makes an ability power roll, you can spend 1 stratagem to decrease the result by one tier, as a free triggered action.

Stratagems remain until you spend it.
