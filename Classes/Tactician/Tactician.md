# Tactician

Strategist. Defender. Leader. With sword in hand, you lead allies into the maw of battle, barking out commands that inspire your fellow heroes to move faster and strike more precisely. All the while, you stand between your compatriots and death, taunting the followers of evil to best you if they can.

As a tactician, you have abilities that heal your allies and grant them increased damage, movement, and attacks.

## Tactician Abilities

You are a formidable combatant in your own right, but your greatest strength in battle is the ability to make your allies even more formidable. You know a range of abilities that shape the scope of your control of the battlefield.

#### Kit Signature Ability

Your additional kit from your Field Arsenal feature grants you a second signature ability. Signature abilities can be used at will.

#### Heroic Abilities

Your heroic abilities cover a range of combat tactics, all of which require focus to use.

#### 3-focus Ability

Choose one heroic ability from the following options, each of which costs 3 focus to use. (*Quick Build:* Inspiring Strike)

#### Battle Cry (3 Focus)

*You shout a phrase that galvanizes your team.*

- *17+:* 12 + M **damage; two allies within 10 squares can each make a signature strike that gains an edge against the target as free triggered actions**

**Effect:** If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina and a strike granted by this ability hasn't been made, the striker can pick a different target.
