| **Distance:** Melee 1 or ranged 5 | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** The target gains two surges and can use a signature or heroic ability as a free triggered action. They have a double edge on the power roll, ignore damage immunity, and increase the potency of effects by 1.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **6 + M damage**
- *12-16:* **10 + M damage**
- *17+:* **14 + M damage**

**Effect:** One ally within 10 can use a heroic ability against the target as a free triggered action without spending any heroic resources, as long as they have enough heroic resources to pay for the ability. If an ability is left to be resolved and the target was reduced to 0 Stamina, the ability user can pick a different target.
