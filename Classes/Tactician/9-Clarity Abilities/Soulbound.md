# Soulbound (9 Clarity)

*You fire a piercing bolt of psychic energy that lances through two foes and leaves a faint intangible thread between them.*

|                                                   |                                                                |

| **Keywords:** Animapathy, Psionic, Ranged, Strike | **Type:** Action **Distance:** Ranged 10 **Target:** 2 enemies |
| **Distance:**                                     | **Target:**                                                    |

- **Power Roll + Presence:**
- *11 or lower:* 8 **damage; A \< \[weak\] directly stitched to other target (save ends)**
- *12-16:* 13 **damage; A \< \[average\] directly stitched to other target (save ends)**
- *17+:* 17 **damage; A \< \[strong\] directly stitched to other target (save ends)**

**Effect:** If one target becomes stitched, they all do. Stitched targets have a bane on power rolls while not adjacent to the creature they're directly stitched to. Whenever a stitched target takes damage that the creatures they're stitched to didn't also take or cause, each creature they're directly stitched to receives half the damage the target took.

**Strained:** You target yourself and 3 enemies instead. You do not take damage from the initial strike. You choose which targets get stitched together.
