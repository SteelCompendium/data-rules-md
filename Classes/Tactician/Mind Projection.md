# Mind Projection

You can project your mind outside of your body as a maneuver. While projecting your mind, you are considered concealed, and you can freely move through solid matter. If you end your turn inside solid matter, you are forced out into the space you originally entered.

Your body remains unconscious and prone while you are in this state. You can immediately return to your body as a free maneuver on your turn. You are instantly shunted back into your body if you or your body take any damage.
