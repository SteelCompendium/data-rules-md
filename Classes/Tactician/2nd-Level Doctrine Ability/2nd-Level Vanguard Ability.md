**Trigger:** The target deals damage to an ally.

**Effect:** You move up to your speed toward the target, ending your move in the nearest square adjacent to them if you can. The triggering ally can spend a Recovery, and gains 5 Temporary Stamina for each enemy you move past while moving to the target. You then make a power roll against the target.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* R \< weak\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*
- *12-16:* R \< average\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*
- *17+:* R \< strong\*\*, frightened of the triggering ally (save ends)\*\*

SQUAD! ON ME!(5 FOCUS)

*Together we are invincible!*

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, each target gains a bonus to their Stability equal to your Might score. Additionally, each target gains two surges.
