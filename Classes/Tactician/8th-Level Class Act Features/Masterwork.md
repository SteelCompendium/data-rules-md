# Masterwork

Select one of your signature abilities and name it after yourself. You always have this ability available even if you switch kits. You always have an edge using this ability and a free surge that you can use on this ability (but on no others).

Additionally, if the last ability you use in an encounter is your named signature, you can immediately use the Hear Ye, Hear Ye! effect of your Words on the Winds feature to tell tales of your exploits after the encounter ends.
