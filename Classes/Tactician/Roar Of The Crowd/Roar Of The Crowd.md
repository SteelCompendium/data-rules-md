# Roar Of The Crowd

You are empowered by your audience, near and far. You can't be frightened, and you can stand up from prone as a free maneuver.

Additionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to invoke an invisible roar of an applauding audience. You and all allies within 3 gain temporary Stamina equal to 10 + your number of active bonds (see Scene Partner) + either your Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher).
