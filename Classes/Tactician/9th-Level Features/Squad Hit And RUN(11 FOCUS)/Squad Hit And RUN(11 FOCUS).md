**Effect:** Each target gains two surges and uses a signature ability with an edge as a free triggered action. After resolving their ability power rolls, each target can shift 2 and become hidden, even without cover or concealment, and even if observed.

THEIR LACK OF FOCUS IS THEIR UNDOING (11 FOCUS) *You trick your enemies into attacking each other and confused by the aftermath*

**Effect:** Each target uses a signature ability under your control and automatically achieves a tier 3 result. After resolving their attacks make a power roll against each target.

**Power Roll + Might:**

- *11 or lower:* **R \< \[weak\] dazed (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **R \< \[average\] dazed (save ends)**
- *17+:* **R \< \[strong\] dazed (save ends)**
