# Studied Commander

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper, with projects seeking common lore becoming free, but still requiring a respite activity to complete. (See Research and Crafting in future packets for more information.)

Additionally, if you have a reasonable amount of time before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have at least one clue or rumor regarding the encounter, you can make a Reason test as a Respite activity. The following test results apply:

- **Combat Encounter:**
    - **11 or lower:** The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.
    - **12-16:** The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.
    - **17+:** As 12-16, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.
- **Negotiation:**
    - **11 or lower:** The Director tells you three different motivations, one of which is one of the NPC's motivations, and the other two are not.
    - **12-16:** The Director tells you one of the NPC's motivations.
    - **17+:** As 12-16, and you and your allies gain an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.

You can only make this test once for each encounter and negotiation.
