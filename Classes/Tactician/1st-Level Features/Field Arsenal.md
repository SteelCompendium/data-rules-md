# Field Arsenal

You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an additional martial kit and gain the benefits of both kits. (See Kits.)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can't change your choice until you finish a Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities of both kits.

For example, if you take the [[Shining Armor]] and [[Sniper]] kits, you gain the following benefits overall:

- **Stamina Bonus:** +12
- **Stability Bonus:** +1
- **Melee Weapon Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2
- **Speed Bonus:** +1
- **Ranged Weapon Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+4
- **Distance Bonus:** +10
- **Mobility:** When an enemy ends their turn adjacent to you, you can shift up to 2 squares as a free triggered action.
- **You also gain the use of the Protective Attack and Patient Shot signature abilities.**

Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses applied. For example, you might take the [[Martial Artist]] kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the [[Mountain]] kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the [[Mountain]] kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the [[Martial Artist]] kit would reduce its damage by −2/−2/−2, as it loses the bonus from the [[Martial Artist]] kit. It then gains the +0/+0/+4 of the [[Mountain]] kit, to deal damage of 3/7/14 for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results.
