# Mark

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability:

## Mark

You draw your allies' attention to a specific foeâ€”with devastating effect.

|                         |                        |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Ranged    | **Type:** Maneuver     |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the start of your next turn. When attacking a marked target, you and each of your allies gain a damage surge (SURGE).\
**Spend 1 Focus or More Focus:** You focus on understanding the tactics of your foe, countering their strengths and exploiting their weaknesses to enhance your squad.

Each focus is banked on the marked creature, increasing the effectiveness of your mark, as indicated on your doctrine's focused mark table below. A marked creature with focus on it stays marked until the end of the encounter. When the marked creature is reduced to 0 Stamina or otherwise removes the mark, you regain the focus.

You can use this maneuver on an already marked creature to bank more focus.
