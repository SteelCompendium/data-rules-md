# **effect:** Choose Two Of The Following Effects:

- The target regains 3 recoveries, which they can immediately spend.
- The target ends all EoT and resistance ends effects, and gains 1 heroic resource.
- The target's speed increases by 3 until the end of the encounter and they gain three surges.

**Strained:** You and the target both grow visibly younger (the equivalent of 20 human years, to the minimum of an eighteen year old). You are frightened of the first nearest enemy that comes within line of effect (save ends).
