# Director Notes

You gain an epic resource called director notes. When you take a Respite, you gain director notes equal to the XP you gain. You can spend director notes as if they were drama on abilities you have.

Additionally, you can spend 1 director note whenever you or a creature within 3 you would fail a test or get a tier-1 result, increasing the result by 1 tier.

Director notes remain until you spend them.
