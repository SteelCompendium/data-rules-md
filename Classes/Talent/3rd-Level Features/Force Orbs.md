**Effect:** You create three size 1T orbs that orbit your body. Each orb you provides you with cumulative damage immunity 1. Whenever you take damage, you lose 1 orb.

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to fire an orb at a creature or object within 5 squares as a ranged strike, losing the orb after the strike.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 damage**
- *12-16:* **3 damage**
- *17+:* **5 damage**

**Strained:** You create five orbs. You are weakened while you have any orbs active.
