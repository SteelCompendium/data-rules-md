**Effect:** You create three size 1T orbs that orbit your body. Each orb you provides you with cumulative damage immunity 1. Whenever you take damage, you lose 1 orb.

Once on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to fire an orb at a creature or object within 5 squares as a ranged strike, losing the orb after the strike.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 damage**
- *12-16:* **3 damage**
- *17+:* **5 damage**

**Strained:** You create five orbs. You are weakened while you have any orbs active.

REFLECTOR FIELD (7 CLARITY)

*A protective field reverses the momentum of incoming attacks.*

**Effect:** The aura lasts until the start of your next turn. Whenever an enemy targets an ally in the aura with a ranged ability, the ability is negated on the ally and reflected back at the enemy. The ability deals half the damage to the enemy that it would have dealt to the ally, and loses any additional effects.

**Strained:** The size of the aura increases by 1. Each ability your aura reflects causes you to take 2d6 damage and makes you forget a memory, as determined in consultation with the Director.

SOUL BURN (7 CLARITY)

*You blast their soul out of their body, leaving it to helplessly float back to a weakened husk.*

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- *11 or lower:* 6 + P **damage;** P \< weak\*\*, dazed (save ends)\*\* o *12-16:* 10 + P **damage;** P \< average\*\*, dazed (save ends)\*\*

- *17+:* 14 + P **damage; P** \< strong\*\*, dazed (save ends)\*\* **Effect:** The target takes a bane on Presence tests until the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** The potency of this ability increases by 1. You take 2d6 damage, and gain 3 surges.
