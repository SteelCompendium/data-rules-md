# Fling Through Time (7 Clarity)

*You hurl the target through the annals of time, forcing them to witness every moment of their existence all at once.*

|                                                                     |                                    |

| **Keywords:** Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged, Strike **Type:** Action | **Type:**                          |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                                             | **Target:** One creature or object |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- *11 or lower:* **3 + P corruption damage;** P \< weak, **weakened (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **5 + P corruption damage; the target is flung through time;** P \< average\*\*, weakened (save ends)\*\*
- *17+:* 8 + P **corruption damage; the target is flung through time; P \< strong, weakened (save ends)**

**Effect:** A target who is flung through time is removed from the encounter until the end of their next turn, reappearing in their original space or the nearest available space.

**Strained:** You take 2d6 damage and grow visibly older (the equivalent of 10 years for a human). On a tier 3 result, you gain 2 clarity.
