# Fling Through Time (7 Clarity)

*You hurl the target through the annals of time, forcing them to witness every moment of their existence all at once.*

|                                            |                                  |
| :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                    | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- 11 or lower: 3 corruption damage; P \[weak\] weakened (save ends)
- 12-16: 5 corruption damage; removed from encounter (EoT); P \[average\] weakened (save ends)
- 17+: 8 corruption damage; removed from encounter (EoT); P \[strong\] weakened (save ends)

**Effect:** When a target removed from the encounter returns, they appear where they were removed or in the closest available space of the Director's choice.\
**Strained:** You take 2d6 damage and you grow visibly older (the equivalent of 10 human years). You gain 2 clarity on a tier-3 result.
