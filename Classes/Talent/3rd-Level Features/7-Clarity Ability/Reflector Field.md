# Reflector Field (7 Clarity)

*A field that reverses the momentum of incoming attacks.*

| **Distance:** 3 Aura                   | **Target:** Self |

**Effect:** The aura lasts until the start of your next turn. Whenever an enemy targets an ally within the aura with a ranged ability, the ability is negated on the ally and reflected back at the enemy, dealing half damage and negating any additional effects.

**Strained:** The aura increases by 1. Each ability your aura reflects causes you to take 2d6 damage and makes you forget a memory.
