You can use a free maneuver to fire an orb at a creature or object within 5 as a ranged attack on each of your turns, losing the orb after the attack.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 11 or lower: 2 damage
- 12-16: 3 damage
- 17+: 5 damage

**Strained:** You create five orbs. You are weakened while you have orbs active.
