# Scan

You can extend your psionic senses out beyond their normal range. You can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver once on each of your turns (see Hide and Sneak). Additionally, once you establish line of effect to a thinking creature within the distance of your Mind Spike ability, you always have line of effect to that creature until they leave move outside that distance.
