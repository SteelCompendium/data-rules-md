# Synaptic Conditioning (9 Clarity)

*It's a subtle mindset shift. It's not that they're your enemy you just don't like them!*

|                                         |                        |

| **Keywords:** Psionic, Melee, Telepathy | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Melee 2                   | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **The target has a bane on ability power rolls made to harm you or your allies (save ends)**
- *12-16:* **The target has a double bane on ability power rolls made to harm you or your allies (save ends)**
- *17+:* **The target considers your allies their allies when using abilities and features (save ends)**

**Strained:** While the target is under this effect, you no longer consider your enemies to be your enemies when using your abilities and features.
