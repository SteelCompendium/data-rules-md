**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **6 damage; vertical pull 5 towards center of area**
- *12-16:* **9 damage; vertical pull 7 towards center of area**
- *17+:* **13 damage; vertical pull 10 towards center of area**

**Effect:** The targets closest to the center are pulled first. **Strained:** The area increases by 2, but you target yourself and allies within distance as well.
