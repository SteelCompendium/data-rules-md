# Incinerate

*The air erupts into a column of smokeless flame.*

|                                                        |                         |

| **Keywords:** Area, Fire, Ranged, Psionic, Pyrokinesis | **Type:** Action        |
| **Distance:** 3 Cube within 10                         | **Target:** All enemies |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **11 or lower:** 2 fire damage
- **12-16:** 3 fire damage
- **17+:** 4 fire damage

**Effect:** The column of fire lingers until the start of your next turn. A creature or object that enters or starts their turn in the affected area takes 2 fire damage.

**Strained:** The cube area increases by 2, but the fire immediately disappears at the end of your turn.
