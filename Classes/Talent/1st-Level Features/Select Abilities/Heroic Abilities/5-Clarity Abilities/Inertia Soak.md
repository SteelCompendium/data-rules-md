# Inertia Soak (5 Clarity)

*Your psionic energy surrounds the target and pushes everything else away from them.*

|                                            |                            |

| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Telekinesis | **Type:** Maneuver         |
| **Distance:** Self or Ranged 10            | **Target:** Self or 1 ally |

**Effect:** The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced movement until the start of your next turn. When the target moves into a square while they have this effect, they can push one adjacent creature 2 squares.\
**Strained:** You are weakened and your stability decreases by 5, which can become a negative value that adds to the distance you are force moved (save ends).
