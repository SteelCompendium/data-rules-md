# Perfect Clarity (5 Clarity)

*You clear the mind of nothing but the goal.*

|                                          |                            |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Telepathy | **Type:** Maneuver         |
| **Distance:** Self or Ranged 10          | **Target:** Self or 1 ally |

**Effect:** The target's speed increases by 3, and they have a double edge on their next power roll made before the start of your next turn. If the target gets a tier-3 result on the roll, you gain 1 clarity.\
**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and you can't use triggered actions (save ends).
