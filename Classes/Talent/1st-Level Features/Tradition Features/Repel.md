| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged   | **Type:** Triggered        |
| **Distance:** Self or Ranged 10 | **Target:** Self or 1 ally |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage or is force moved.

**Effect:** The target gains `ðŸ›¡` against the damage, or the force movement distance is reduced by an amount equal to your Reason score. If they were both damaged and force moved, you choose which is affected. If any forced movement was reduced to 0, the source of the forced movement is pushed a number of squares equal to your Reason, originating from the target. You gain 1 clarity.
