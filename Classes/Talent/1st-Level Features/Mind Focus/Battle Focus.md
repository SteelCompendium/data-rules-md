# Battle Focus

You can wear medium armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don't have a kit. While you wear medium armor, you gain a +6 bonus to Stamina. While you wield a light weapon, you deal 1 extra damage with abilities that have the Weapon keyword, including free strikes. You can use medium armor and light weapon treasures. If you have a kit, you can't take this focus.
