# Inertia Soak (5 Clarity)

*Your psionic energy surrounds the target and pushes everything else away from them.* **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Telekinesis

| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** Self or one ally |

**Effect:** The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced movement until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target moves into a square while under this effect, they can push one adjacent creature up to 2 squares. If pushing an ally, the target can ignore that ally's stability.

**Strained:** You are weakened and your stability decreases by 5 (save ends). If your stability becomes a negative value, it adds to the distance you are force moved.
