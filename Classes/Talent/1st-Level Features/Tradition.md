# Tradition

Psionic abilities manifest into one of multiple categories. Some examples of categories include:

- **Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.
- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air within and around the environment.
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits.
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.
- **Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.
- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.

As talents gain mastery over their minds, they find a tradition for one psionic category that's as easy to manifest as it is to breathe. Choose one of the following categories to be your tradition: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. Other talent affinities will be featured in future products. Your choice determines your Tradition Triggered Action and Tradition Features in addition to several features you get at later levels.
