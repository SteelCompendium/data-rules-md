**Effect:** When targeting an object with a solid reflective surface or a creature carrying or wearing such an object (a mirror, an unpainted metal shield, shiny metal plate armor, and so forth), you can choose an additional target within 3 squares of the first target.

**Strained:** You gain a surge, which you can use immediately, and take damage equal to your Reason score, which can't be reduced in any way.
