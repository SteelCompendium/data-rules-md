| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** Self or one ally |

**Effect:** Until the start of your next turn, the target gains a +3 bonus to speed, and they have a double edge on the next power roll they make. If the target gets a tier 3 result on that roll, you gain 1 clarity.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage, and you can't use triggered actions (save ends).
