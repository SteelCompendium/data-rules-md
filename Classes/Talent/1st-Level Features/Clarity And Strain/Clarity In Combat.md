# Clarity In Combat

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns in combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.

You can choose to spend clarity you do not have, going into negative numbers. Your negative clarity limit is equal to 1 + your Reason. At the end of your turn, you take 1d6 damage for each clarity you have below 0.

While you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

Your clarity disappears at the end of the encounter.
