# Clarity Outside Of Combat

Though you can't gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. If you use two or more heroic abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using them.

Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs clarity outside of combat, you can't use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.
