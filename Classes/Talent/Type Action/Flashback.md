# Flashback (5 Clarity)

*The target is thrown several seconds back through time, and gets to do it all again.*

|                                            |                                                                         |

**Effect:** The target immediately uses an ability they've previously used this round without spending any heroic resources.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and are slowed (save ends).
