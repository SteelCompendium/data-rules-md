# Fulcrum (11 Clarity)

*You use fine precision to manipulate the creatures around you.* **Keywords:** Area, Psionic, Telekinesis

|                       |                                     |

| **Keywords:**         | **Type:** Action                    |
| **Distance:** Special | **Target:** All enemies and objects |

**Effect:** Each target is vertically pushed 4. Roll power to determine the distance the ability affects.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **2 Burst**
- *12-16:* **3 Burst**
- *17+:* **4 Burst**

**Strained:** You can choose to reduce the area of the burst by 2 (to a minimum of 1 Burst) to increase the force movement by 2. You take half the damage all targets take from forced movement.
