*You latch onto your prey's brain and don't let go, like a song they can't get out of their head.* **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathic

| **Keywords:**           | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** 1 creature |

- **Power Roll + Reason:** o *11 or lower:* 10 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[weak\] slowed (save ends)**
- *12-16:* 14 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)**
- *17+:* 20 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[strong\] slowed (save ends)**

**Effect:** The target takes 3 psychic damage for each square they willingly move out of while slowed by this ability.

**Strained:** The target, instead, takes 5 psychic damage for each square they move out of, but you feel the pain and have a double bane on ability power rolls made against the target while they are slowed by this ability.
