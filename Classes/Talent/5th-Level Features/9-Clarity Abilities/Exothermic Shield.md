# Exothermic Shield (9 Clarity)

*You encase the target in psionic flame and allow them to flicker without fear of burning out.*

| **Distance:**                                                                                                     | **Target:** |

**Effect:** The target gains fire and cold immunity 10 and their strikes have deal additional fire damage equal to twice your Reason score until the start of your next turn. Additionally, whenever an enemy makes physical contact with the target or uses a melee ability against the target while they have this effect, the enemy takes 5 fire damage.

**Strained:** The target gains two surges. You are weakened and slowed (save ends).

HYPERSONIC (9 CLARITY)

*You move fast enough to turn around and watch your foes feel the aftermath.*

**Effect:** You teleport to a square on the opposite side of the area before rolling power.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **12 sonic damage**
- *12-16:* **18 sonic damage**
- *17+:* **24 sonic damage**

**Strained:** You and each target are slowed (EoT) on a tier 2 result or higher.

MIND SNARE (9 CLARITY)

*You latch onto your prey's brain and don't let go, like a song they can't get out of their head.*

- **Power Roll + Reason:** o *11 or lower:* 10 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[weak\] slowed (save ends)**
- *12-16:* 14 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[average\] slowed (save ends)**
- *17+:* 20 + R **psychic damage; R \< \[strong\] slowed (save ends)**

**Effect:** The target takes 3 psychic damage for each square they willingly move out of while slowed by this ability.

**Strained:** The target, instead, takes 5 psychic damage for each square they move out of, but you feel the pain and have a double bane on ability power rolls made against the target while they are slowed by this ability.
