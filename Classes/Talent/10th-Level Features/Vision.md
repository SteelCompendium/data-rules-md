# Vision

You gain an epic resource called vision. When you take a Respite, you gain ordinance equal to the XP you gain. You can spend vision as if it were clarity on abilities you have.

Additionally, you can spend vision to use an additional psionic ability on your turn, provided you pay the entire cost of the ability in vision. If you choose to use a psionic ability that normally costs no clarity, you must spend 1 vision to use it.

Vision remains until you spend it.
