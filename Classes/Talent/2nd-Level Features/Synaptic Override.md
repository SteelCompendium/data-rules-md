| **Keywords:**           | **Type:** Action      |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10 | **Target:** One enemy |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- *11 or lower:* **The target makes a free strike against one enemy of your choice.**
- *12-16:* **The target shifts up to their speed and uses their signature ability against any enemies of your choice**.
- *17+:* **The target moves up to their speed and uses their signature ability against any enemies of your choice.**

**Effect:** You control the target's movement. The target can't be moved in a way that would harm them (such as over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition or other negative effect. However, you can move them to provoke opportunity attacks if applicable.

**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and are weakened until the end of your turn.
