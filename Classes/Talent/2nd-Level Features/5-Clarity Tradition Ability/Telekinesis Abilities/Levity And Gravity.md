# Levity And Gravity (5 Clarity)

*You raise the target into the air and smother them against the ground.*

|                                                    |                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Attack, Psionic, Ranged, Telekinesis | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                            | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 11 or lower: 6 damage; M \[weak\] prone
- 12-16: 10 damage; M \[average\] prone
- 17+: 14 damage; M \[strong\] prone can't stand (save ends)

**Effect:** A target made prone by this ability is lifted 2 squares into the air before falling immediately to the ground.\
**Strained:** You take half the damage the target takes, including any damage from falling.
