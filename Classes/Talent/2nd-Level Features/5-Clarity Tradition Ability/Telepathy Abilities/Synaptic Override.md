*You gain control over an enemy's nervous system. How pleasant for them.*

|                                          |                     |

| **Keywords:** Psionic, Ranged, Telepathy | **Type:** Action    |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                  | **Target:** 1 enemy |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- 11 or lower: Target takes a free strike on an enemy of your choice
- 12-16: Target shifts up to their speed and uses their signature ability against targets of your choice
- 17+: Target moves up to their speed and uses their signature ability against targets of your choice

**Effect:** You control the target's movement. You can't move the target in a way that puts them in harm's way, such as off a cliff. However, you can move them in a way that provokes opportunity attacks.\
**Strained:** You take 1d6 damage and you are weakened (EoT).
