# Overwhelm (5 Clarity)

*You overload their senses, turning all their subconscious thoughts into conscious ones.*

|                                                  |                        |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Attack, Psionic, Ranged, Telepathy | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Ranged 10                          | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **11 or lower:** 6 psychic damage; I \[weak\] slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 psychic damage; I \[average\] weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 14 psychic damage; I \[strong\] dazed (save ends)

**Strained:** You start crying. You can't take triggered actions or take free strikes until the end of the target's next turn.
