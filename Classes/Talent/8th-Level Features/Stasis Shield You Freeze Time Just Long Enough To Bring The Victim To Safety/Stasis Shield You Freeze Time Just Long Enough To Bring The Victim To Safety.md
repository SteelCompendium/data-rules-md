**Trigger:** The target takes damage.

**Effect:** The target is teleported to an unoccupied square adjacent to you, taking no damage or additional effects if this movement would put them out of harm's way. **Strained:** You can't target yourself if you are strained. You take the damage and any additional effects in place of the target.
