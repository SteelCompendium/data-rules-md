**Power Roll + Presence:**

? *11 or lower:* **10 + P damage; P \< \[weak\] weakened**

- **(save ends)** ? *12-16:* **14 + P damage; P \< \[average\] weakened**
- **(save ends)** ? *17+:* **20 + P damage; P \< \[strong\] weakened and slowed (save ends)**

**Effect:** This ability has an edge against targets with a soul. After rolling power, you or an ally within range have a double edge on the next power roll you make before the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You feel dispirited until you take a respite. On a tier-3 result, you and the target have damage weakness 5 (save ends).
