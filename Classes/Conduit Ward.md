#### Conduit Ward

Your god grants you a ward that protects you from the faithless. Choose one of the following wards. You can change your ward along with your prayer (see Prayer above) by praying to your god as a respite activity. (*Quick Build:* Bastion Ward.)

##### Bastion Ward

Your god grants you a holy countenance that protects you at all times. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

##### Quickness Ward

The gods imbue a divine swiftness within you. Whenever an adjacent creature deals damage to you, you can shift up to a number of squares equal to your Intuition score after the damage is dealt.

##### Sanctuary Ward

In response to a foe's aggression, your god protects you. Whenever another creature damages you, that creature can't target you with a strike until you harm them or one of their allies, or until the end of their next turn.

##### Spirit Ward

Invisible spirits surround you if you are harmed. Whenever an adjacent creature deals damage to you, they take corruption damage equal to your Intuition score.
