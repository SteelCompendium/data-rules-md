# Retiarius

The retiarius is often depicted as a lightly armored warrior with a net in one hand and a trident in the other, and this kit gives you the equipment and fighting technique to make that happen. Tie up your foe with a net and then poke them to death!

## Equipment

You wear light armor, and wield a polearm and several ensnaring weapons.

## Kit Bonuses

- Stamina Bonus: +3
- Speed Bonus: +1
- Melee Weapon Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
- Reach Bonus: +1
- Mobility: When an enemy ends their turn adjacent to you, you can shift up to 2 squares as a free triggered action.

## Signature Ability

**Net and Stab** The well-thrown net that follows your main attack leaves your foes right where you want them.
