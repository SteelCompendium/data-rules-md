# Meditator

The Meditator kit allows you to wield magic hardened by experience and isolation. Your spirit visibly extends beyond your physical form in the form of moss, spores, and pulsing aura of light. While using this kit, you tend to skip meals and ignore inclement weather.

## Equipment

You wear light armor and wield an implement of bone such as a staff or a skull.

## Kit Bonuses

- Stamina Bonus: +9
- Speed Bonus: +1

## Signature Ability: Bountiful Decay

Your curse causes a foe's flesh to rot off as spores that aid your allies.

Your spirit overflows and warms the area around you. It grants you the following benefits:

- You gain an edge on resistance rolls.
- Whenever an enemy damages you with a melee ability, you deal corruption damage to that enemy equal to your highest characteristic score.
