# Dancer

The Dancer kit forgoes nearly all equipment in exchange for speed, letting you rely purely on kinetic energy to channel your power. The more you move, the more others may want to move with you. Select this kit when your party regularly needs to close the distance on your enemies. While you use this kit, your heartbeat becomes an audible metronome.

## Equipment

You don a tiny implement of glass such as a pendant or an anklet.

## Kit Bonuses

- Speed Bonus: +2
- Magic Damage Bonus: +0/+1/+2

## Signature Ability: Tarantella Volley

Visible energy sparks off you to wash across a nearby foe, who you invite to dance with you.

| **Keywords:** Attack, Magic, Melee | **Type:** Action                 |
| **Distance:** Reach 2              | **Target:** 1 creature or object |

**Power Roll** + Agility, Intuition, or Presence:

- 11 or lower: 2 damage
- 12â€“16: 7 damage; you swap places with the target
- 17+: 11 damage; you swap places with the target, and a hero within distance can shift up to 2 squares

**Effect**: If you roll a 12 or better and can't swap places with the target because one or both of you is too big to fit into the swapped space, you both remain in your original spaces and the target takes 2 extra damage.

## Kit Ward: Waltzing Ward

Your ward surrounds you with a soft, enchanting melody whose volume you control, and grants you the following benefits:

- Whenever an enemy ends their turn adjacent to you, you can shift 2 squares as a free triggered action.
- Whenever a creature damages you with a melee ability, you can slide them a number of squares equal to your highest characteristic score.
