When you use this kit, your competitive nature is more pronounced, and you wield your implement recklessly.

## Equipment

You wield an implement of wood such as an orb or a hooked rod.

## Kit Bonuses

- Magic Damage Bonus: +0/+1/+2
- Magic Distance Bonus: +10

## Signature Ability: Spike!

You lob your implement at high speed toward your opponent, unleashing a chaotic flare of magic.

## Kit Ward: Magic Eye Ward

Your ward wraps itself around your head and shields your eyes, granting you the following benefits:

- You have Ranged immunity equal to your highest characteristic score.
- Whenever an enemy within 15 squares of you damages you with a ranged ability, your ward locks onto them until the end of the encounter.
