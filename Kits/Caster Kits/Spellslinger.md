## Kit Ward: Invigorating Ward

Your ward surrounds you with crackling energy.

Whenever you take damage, you gain a bonus to damage equal to your highest characteristic score, which you apply to the next damage-dealing magic ability you use before the end of the encounter. This benefit is cumulative, so that you can accrue bonus damage multiple times, then expend it all on one use of an ability.
