# Bloodpact

Sometimes you need a direct line to your heart to get the most of your magic. The Bloodpact kit trades your blood or lifeforce for more power and heightened casting. With careful control of your natural resources (or borrowing someone else's), you can take care of business before succumbing to your own hubris. While using this kit, the smell of blood becomes super intense to your senses.

## Equipment

You wield an implement of metal, such as a tome or a crown.

## Kit Bonuses

- Stamina Bonus: +6
- Magic Damage Bonus: +2/+2/+2
- Magic Distance Bonus: +5

## Signature Ability: Drain

You drain the energy from your target and revitalize your senses.

| **Distance:** Reach                | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll** + Reason, Intuition, or Presence:

- 11 or lower: 5 corruption damage
- 12-16: 10 corruption damage
- 17+: 14 corruption damage; you can spend 1 recovery to regain Stamina

## Kit Ward: Blood Ward

The blood ward is a large projection of your heart that magnifies the sound of your heartbeat. Whenever an ability lets you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to instead increase your speed by 2 and have your abilities deal 2 extra corruption damage until the end of the encounter instead.
