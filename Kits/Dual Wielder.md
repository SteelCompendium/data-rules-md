**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- **11 or lower:** 4 damage
- **12-16:** 5 damage
- **17+:** 6 damage

**Effect:** If you use this ability on your turn, you can target one creature or object with it then use your maneuver and move action for that turn before targeting a second creature or object. You still use the same power roll for both targets.
