- Who or what did you lose at sea?

You gain the following career benefits:

| 1   | **Alone:** You joined up with your best friend, sibling, or other loved one, the culmination of a lifelong dream to sail the high seas together. When they died, you lost your taste for the seafaring life. You left at the first chance you got and haven't looked back.                                                                       |
| 2   | **Deserter:** It was in the middle of a raid when you realized you no longer believed in a life of piracy. You used the chaos of the moment to slip away unnoticed. You now work as a hero in an effort to atone for your past deeds and fear the day your old crew finds you.                                                                   |
| 3   | **Forgotten:** You awoke aboard your ship with no memory of who you had been before. Though the other sailors insisted they knew you, you didn't know them. The next time you went ashore, you decided to stay, determined to find out who you really are.                                                                                       |
| 4   | **Jealousy:** You had the favor of your captain, a fact that earned you many rivals aboard your ship. One night, your fellow sailors pulled you from your bunk and threw you overboard. By some miracle, you were scooped from the waters by a passing vessel. You worked off your debt to them, then set out on a new life with less pettiness. |
| 5   | **Marooned:** There was a mutiny, and you were on the wrong side. You were marooned on an island and escaped when a merchant vessel got blown off course by a storm and found you. Your reputation is ruined among sailors, so you seek adventure elsewhere.                                                                                     |
| 6   | **Water Fear:** A catastrophic storm hit while you were at sea, destroying the ship and leaving you as the only survivor. Once you recovered, you tried to sign on with another ship, but the thought of the open water turns your legs to jelly. Instead, you've taken on the role of traveling hero to make ends meet.                         |
