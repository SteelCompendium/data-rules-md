# Watch Officer

You served as an officer of the law for a local government. You might have been a single person in a much larger city watch or the only constable patrolling a small village. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What type of settlement did you protect?
- What was your law enforcement style like? Were you a by-the-book officer, a totally corrupt cop, or a more lenient but fair type?
- What [[Criminal|criminal]] to this day has still eluded your grasp?
- Whose life did you save while in the line of duty?
- What is the most absurd call you ever responded to, and how did you handle it?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** Alertness, plus two skills from the intrigue skill group.
- **Languages:** Two languages.
- **Perk:** One perk from the exploration perk type.

| 2   | **Corruption Within:** You joined the force to help the helpless and bring justice to those wronged. You weren't prepared for the rampant corruption reaching the top of your organization. You refused to cover for your fellow officers and were told in no simple terms to leave town or face the consequences. Now you travel as a hero, acting as the protector you always wanted to be.                |
| 3   | **Frame Job:** Your partner was murdered. That's irrefutable. But you didn't do it, despite what the evidence implies. When it became clear you would take the fall, you fled, leaving everything behind. Not content to cower in the shadows, you decided to adventure under a new name while you work to clear your own.                                                                                   |
| 4   | **Missing Mentor:** You learned everything you know about the job from someone you always looked up to in a corrupt organization. One night, they sent you a cryptic message that they'd discovered “something big,” but before you found out more, they disappeared. No longer sure who you could trust, you slipped away and sought a new life. Now you do what good you can and search to find the truth. |
| 5   | **One that Got Away:** A particularly violent or depraved [[Criminal\|criminal]] evaded your grasp and then began targeting you—perhaps they stole something personal or hurt someone you love—before slipping through your grasp again. You left to pursue the [[Criminal\|criminal]], but the trail has gone cold… for now. Might as well help folks in the meantime.                                      |
| 6   | **Powerful Enemies:** You made it your responsibility to root out and bring down the region's foremost crime syndicate. They sent goons to burn down your home and teach you a lesson. They left you [[Bleeding\|bleeding]] in the street, with nothing left except your life. You've taken on the life of a hero to gain the power and influence you need to destroy the syndicate once and for all.        |
