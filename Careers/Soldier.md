# Soldier

In your formative years, you fought tirelessly in skirmishes and campaigns against enemy forces. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- Which army and company did you serve?
- What conflicts were you a part of?
- What rank did you achieve?
- What heroics did you perform in the heat of battle?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills**: One skill from each of the exploration skill group and the intrigue skill group
- **Languages**: Two languages
- **Renown**: 1
- **Title**â€”Drill Sergeant: At the start of a group test or montage test, you can spend a hope token. If you do, all participants make tests as if they also had your exploration skills.
