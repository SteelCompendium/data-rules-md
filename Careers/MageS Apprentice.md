| 1   | **Oops**: While studying magic, you accidentally sent yourself from your original world to this one. Now you're stranded here, hoping to get back home by finding ancient texts or powerful magical treasures that might transport you there. A life of adventure it is!                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | **Ultimate Power**: The mage you worked for was a kindly old soul, but the basic magic they taught you always seemed like a small part of something bigger. It wasn't until you met an adventuring elementalist that you realized hitting the road as a hero was the only way to truly improve and hone your skills. You resigned your apprenticeship and found yourself walking the path of a hero the next day. |
| 3   | **Missing Mage**: One day you woke up and the mage you worked for was just gone. They didn't take any of their belongings, and there was no sign of any foul play—just the scent of sulfur in their bedchamber. You set out on your heroic journey in the aftermath, and have been looking for them ever since.                                                                                                   |
