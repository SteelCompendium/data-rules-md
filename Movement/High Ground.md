# High Ground

When you make an attack against a creature or object while occupying a space that is fully above the space the target takes up, with the bottom of your space higher than the top of the target's space, you gain an edge on the power roll against that target. You must be standing, swimming, or flying to gain this benefit, or jumping unless the Director deems otherwise. You don't get the benefit while climbing unless your speed has the *Climb* keyword.
