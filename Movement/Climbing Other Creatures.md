# Climbing Other Creatures

You can attempt to climb a creature whose size is greater than yours. If the creature is willing, you can climb them without any trouble. If the creature is unwilling, you make the following test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- 11 or lower: You fail to climb the creature, and they can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against you.
- 12–16: You fail to climb the creature.
- 17+: You climb the creature.

While you climb or ride a creature, you gain an edge to melee attacks against them. The creature can use a maneuver to attempt to knock you off. If you are knocked off a creature, you must make the following test:

**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**

- 11 or lower: You fall off the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice, taking falling damage and landing [[Prone|prone]] as usual (see Falling in Adventuring).
- 12–16: You slide down the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice and don't land [[Prone|prone]].
- 17+: You continue to hold on to the creature.

If you are knocked [[Prone|prone]] while climbing or riding a creature, you fall and land [[Prone|prone]] in an adjacent space of your choice, taking damage as usual from the fall.
