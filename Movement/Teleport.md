# Teleport

When you teleport, you move from one space to another space instantaneously. The following rules apply to teleporting:

- Teleporting doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- When you teleport, you bypass any obstacles between the space you leave and your destination space.
- The creature teleporting you must have line of effect from the space you leave and to your destination space.
- Your destination space can't be occupied by another creature or object.
- You don't spend your movement when you teleport. Instead, the effect that lets you teleport tells you how far you can teleport.
- If you teleport while [[Prone|prone]], you can be standing when you reach your destination space provided you are able to stand. If another creature teleports you, it is up to them if you remain [[Prone|prone]] or stand, provided you are able.
- If you teleport while affected by the [[Grabbed|grabbed]] or [[Restrained|restrained]] conditions, those conditions end for you.
