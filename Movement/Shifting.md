# Shifting

Whenever you use your move action or when another effect allows you to move, you can instead shift to use up to half the maximum squares of movement the effect allows. Whenever you shift, creatures can't make opportunity attacks against you during your movement (see [[Free Strike|Free Strikes]]).

Certain effects might also allow you to shift a specific number of squares, including many effects that let you shift up to your speed.
