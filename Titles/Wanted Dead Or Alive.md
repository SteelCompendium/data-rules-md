# Wanted Dead Or Alive

“While you were dreaming about that big bounty on our heads, you forgot that Dead or Alive is a game we can play too. So before you try to put those manacles on my wrist, ask yourself this: a minute from now, do you want to be dead? Or do you want to be alive?”

**Prerequisites:** You are declared an outlaw by a governmental authority.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Honor Among Thieves:** You are considered to have 2 higher Renown when negotiating with [[Criminal|criminals]].
- **Minion Mower:** When you make a melee attack that targets a minion and at least one more minion is within distance of the attack, the attack gains `⚡`.
- **No, You're Under Arrest!:** You gain an edge on resistance rolls made to escape a [[Grab|grab]]. Additionally, when you make a successful test to escape manacles or bonds, as part of the same maneuver you can transfer the manacles or bonds to another person adjacent to you without them immediately noticing.
