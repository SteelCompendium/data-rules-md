# Doomed

“That day. Under the sun, when Sulur the [[Hakaan]] fell beneath the [[Raider|raiders]]' swords, I saw something. I think I was seeing this moment….SULUR! I'M ON MY WAY!”

**Prerequisites:** You are not a [[Hakaan]] but have witnessed the death of a [[Hakaan]].

You're not destined for a meaningful death, but you still might achieve one. When you're reduced to 0 Stamina but still conscious, you can choose to become doomed. If you do, you can't regain hit points, you automatically get tier 3 results on tests and resistance rolls, and you don't die until your Stamina equals the negative of your maximum Stamina value. At the end of the encounter, you die.
