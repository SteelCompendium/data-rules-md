# Mage Hunter

“Every time you use magic, you open a door, and something from outside our world reaches in. I'm here to shut that door.”

**Prerequisites:** You defeat three leaders or solo monsters who could each use at least one ability with the Magic keyword.

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Arcane Dampening:** Attacks with the Magic keyword take a bane if they target you, and you gain an edge on resistance rolls against abilities with the Magic keyword.
- **Oh No You Don't!:** When an adjacent creature uses an ability with the Magic keyword, you can make a [[Free Strike|free strike]] against them as a triggered action.
- **Stink of Magic:** As a maneuver, you can open your senses to the residue of magic. Until the end of your next turn, you are aware whether each creature within 5 squares of you is an undead, construct, or creature from another plane of existence, and whether they have used an ability with the Magic keyword in the past hour. Additionally, you never suffer the penalties of being surprised by undead, constructs, or creatures from another plane of existence.
