# Dwarven Legionnaire

“I am a [[Mountain|mountain]], my feet are its roots! My friends are my range and my foes get the boot!”

**Prerequisites:** You fight alongside at least three [[Dwarf|dwarves]].

Choose one of the following benefits:

- **Close Formation:** Your stability increases by 2 while adjacent to at least two allies.
- **Rune of Alarm:** You can spend 10 minutes to inscribe a magical eye-shaped rune on a surface. The rune sheds light for 2 squares. It is dispelled if it is activated or if you inscribe the rune elsewhere. The rune is activated when an enemy comes within 2 squares of the rune.

When the rune is activated, you wake up if you are nonmagically asleep, and for 1 minute you can see through the rune as if you were in its square. - **Stonemeld:** While adjacent to a stone wall, you can use a maneuver to gain concealment. The concealment lasts until you leave the square or use an ability.
