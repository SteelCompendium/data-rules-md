##### 2nd-Level Auteur Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

<!-- -->
> ###### Guest Star (5 Drama)
>
> *We offered them a percentage of the gross. So they're working for free!*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** | **Main action** |
> | ----------------- | --------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  |  **🎯 Special** |
>
> **Effect:** A guest star appears to help you during the encounter: either a bystander within distance uplifted by your magic, or a mysterious new hero who appears in an unoccupied space within distance. This guest star is controlled by you, has their own turn, and shares your characteristics. Their Stamina maximum is half yours. They have no abilities other than your melee and ranged free strikes. At the end of the encounter, or when the guest star is reduced to 0 Stamina, they retreat or revert to a bystander. The same bystander can't be uplifted this way more than once during an encounter.

> ###### Twist at the End (5 Drama)

> *You didn't see that coming, did you?!*
>
> | **Magic, Ranged** |       **Main action** |
> | ----------------- | --------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 One dead enemy** |
>
> **Effect:** A target who is not a leader or solo creature comes back to life with half their Stamina and becomes an ally under the Director's control. The players can work with the Director to determine when the target takes their turn each combat round. At the end of the encounter, the target turns to dust and is blown away.
