#### Stasis Shield

You have the following ability.

<!-- -->
> ###### Stasis Shield (3 Clarity)
>
> *You freeze time just long enough to bring the victim to safety!*
>
> | **Psionic, Ranged** |                          **Triggered** |
> | ------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
> | **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 Self, or one creature or object** |
>
> **Trigger:** The target takes damage.
>
> **Effect:** The target is teleported to an unoccupied space adjacent to you, taking no damage and suffering no additional effects if this movement would get them out of harm's way.
>
> **Strained:** You can't target yourself, and you take the damage and any additional effects instead of the target.
