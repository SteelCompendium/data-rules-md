> | **Magic**              | **Maneuver** |
> | ---------------------- | -----------: |
> | **📏 Self; see below** |  **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:
>
> - You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its distance becomes the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for the power roll.
> - You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.
> - You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If you choose this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional square for each essence spent.
