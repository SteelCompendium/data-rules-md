##### 2nd-Level Caustic Alchemy Ability

Choose one of the following abilities.

<!-- -->
> ###### Sticky Bomb (5 Insight)

>
> | **Ranged**       |     **Main action** |

> **Effect:** You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature otherwise notices the bomb and can disarm and remove it as a main action. If they don't, at the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. When the bomb detonates, you make a power roll targeting each enemy within 2 squares of it.
>
> **Power Roll + Agility:**
>
> - **≤11:** 4 + A fire damage
> - **12-16:** 7 + A fire damage
> - **17+:** 11 + A fire damage
