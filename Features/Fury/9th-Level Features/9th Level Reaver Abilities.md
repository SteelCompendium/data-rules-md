<!-- -->
> ###### Shower of Blood (11 Ferocity)
>
> *You shock your foes with the brutality of your strike, resetting the balance of combat.*
>
> | **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
> | ------------------------- | ------------------: |
> | **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

> **Effect:** Each enemy within 5 squares of you is distracted until the end of the round. While a creature is distracted this way, they can't take triggered actions or free triggered actions, ability rolls made against them gain an edge, and their characteristic scores are considered 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies.
