You attempt to grab a creature using the following ability:

**GRAB**

|                       |                                                          |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Melee   | **Type:** Maneuver                                       |
| **Distance:** Reach 1 | **Target:** 1 creature the same size or smaller than you |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- 11 or lower: No effect
- 12â€“16: You can grab the target, but if you do, they can make a melee [[Free Strike|free strike]] against you right before they become [[Grabbed|grabbed]] by you.
- 17+: The target is [[Grabbed|grabbed]] by you.

**Effect:** You gain an edge on the power roll if the creature's size is smaller than yours. You can grab only one creature at a time this way.
