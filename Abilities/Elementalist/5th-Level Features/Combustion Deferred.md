###### Combustion Deferred (9 Essence)

*Your flames dance from kindling to kindling to kindling.*

| **Fire, Magic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 8 + R fire damage
- **12-16:** 13 + R fire damage
- **17+:** 17 + R fire damage

**Effect:** When the target ends their next turn, or if they drop to 0 Stamina before then, each enemy adjacent to them takes fire damage equal to twice your Reason score. Each affected enemy then gains this same effect.
