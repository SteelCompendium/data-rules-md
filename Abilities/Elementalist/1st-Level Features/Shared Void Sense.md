###### Shared Void Sense

*You grant allies a taste of your unearthly vision.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Void** |   **Maneuver** |
| ----------------------- | -------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**        | **🎯 Special** |

**Effect:** For each Victory you have, you can target one creature. Each target gains the benefit of your A Beyonding of Vision feature until the end of your next turn, but doesn't gain the use of the Shared Void Sense ability.
