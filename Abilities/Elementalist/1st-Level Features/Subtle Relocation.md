**Trigger:** The target starts their turn, moves, or is force moved. **Effect:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If the target moves to trigger this ability, you can teleport them at any point during the move.

**Spend 1 Essence:** You teleport the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Reason score instead.
