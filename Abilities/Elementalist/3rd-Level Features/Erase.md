###### Erase (7 Essence)

*With a flick of the wrist, you phase creatures out of existence.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike, Void** | **Main action** |
| ------------------------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                |  **🎯 Special** |

**Special:** The number of creatures you target with this ability is determined by your power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** One creature
- **12-16:** Two creatures
- **17+:** Three creatures

**Effect:** Each target begins to fade from existence (save ends). On their first turn while fading from existence, a target takes a bane on power rolls. At the end of their first turn, they have a double bane on power rolls. At the end of their second turn, they fade from existence for 1 hour, after which they reappear in their original space or the nearest unoccupied space.
