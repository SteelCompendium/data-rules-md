###### World Torn Asunder (11 Essence)

*You stomp your foot and quake the whole world over.*

| **Area, Earth, Magic** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 5 burst**         | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** M < WEAK, prone
- **12-16:** M < AVERAGE, prone
- **17+:** M < STRONG, prone

**Effect:** You create a fissure in the ground adjacent to you that is a 10 × 2 line and 6 squares deep. Each creature in the area who is prone and size 2 or smaller falls in. Other creatures can enter the fissure or can shift to the nearest unoccupied space of their choice outside it.
