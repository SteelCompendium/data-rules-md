###### Synaptic Anchor (11 Discipline)

*You disrupt an enemy's strike and create a feedback loop in their mind, preventing them from focusing on future attacks.*

| **Psionic**            |          **Free triggered** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------: |
| **📏 Self; see below** | **🎯 Self or one creature** |

**Trigger:** The target takes damage from another creature's ability while in the area of your Null Field ability.

**Effect:** The target takes half the damage, and if the triggering crea ture has I < AVERAGE, they are dazed (save ends). While the triggering creature is dazed this way, they take psychic damage equal to your Intuition score whenever they use a main action.
