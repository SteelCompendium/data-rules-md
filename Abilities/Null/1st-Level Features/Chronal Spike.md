###### Chronal Spike (3 Discipline)

*You foresee the best moment to strike, then exploit it.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 7 + A damage
- **12-16:** 10 + A damage
- **17+:** 13 + A damage

**Effect:** You can shift up to half your speed before or after you make this strike. Additionally, whenever an effect lets you make a free strike or use a signature ability, you can use this ability instead, paying its discipline cost as usual.
