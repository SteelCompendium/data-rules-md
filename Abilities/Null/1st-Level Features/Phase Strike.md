###### Phase Strike (5 Discipline)

*For a moment, your foe slips out of phase with this manifold.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 3 + A psychic damage; I < WEAK, the target goes out of phase (save ends)
- **12-16:** 4 + A psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, the target goes out of phase (save ends)
- **17+:** 6 + A psychic damage; I < STRONG, the target goes out of phase (save ends)

**Effect:** A target who goes out of phase is slowed, has their stability reduced by 2, and can't obtain a tier 3 outcome on ability rolls.
