###### Phase Inversion Strike

*You step momentarily out of phase as you pull an enemy through you.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- \*\*≤11:\*\*4 + A damage; push 2
- **12-16:** 6 + A damage; push 4
- **17+:** 8 + A damage; push 6

**Effect:** Before the push is resolved, you teleport the target to a square adjacent to you and opposite the one they started in. If the target can't be teleported this way, you can't push them.
