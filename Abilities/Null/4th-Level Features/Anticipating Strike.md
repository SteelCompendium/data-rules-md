###### Anticipating Strike (9 Discipline)

*You suddenly strike an enemy, then grab them in a psionically enhanced grip.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |    **Free trigger** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target moves or uses a main action.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 7 + A damage; I < WEAK, restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 + A damage; I < AVERAGE, restrained (save ends)
- **17+:** 13 + A damage; I < STRONG, restrained (save ends)

**Effect:** This strike resolves before the triggering movement or main action.
