###### Iron Grip (9 Discipline)

*You grab the target with supernatural force.*

| **Melee, Psionic, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                     | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 10 + A damage; A < WEAK, grabbed
- **12-16:** 14 + A damage; A < AVERAGE, grabbed
- **17+:** 18 + A damage; A < STRONG, grabbed

**Effect:** While grabbed this way, the target takes a bane on the Escape Grab maneuver. Each time they use that maneuver, they take damage equal to twice your Agility score.
