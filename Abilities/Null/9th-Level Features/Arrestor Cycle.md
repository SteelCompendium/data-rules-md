###### Arrestor Cycle (11 Discipline)

*You trap your foe in a looping cycle of time, where they relive the last few seconds over and over again.*

| **Psionic, Ranged** |  **Free triggered** |
| ------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**    | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The triggering creature starts their turn.

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- **≤11:** I < WEAK, the target loses their turn
- **12-16:** I < AVERAGE, the target loses their turn
- **17+:** I < STRONG, the target loses their turn

**Effect:** If the target loses their turn, the round continues as if they had acted. A target who doesn't lose their turn takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intuition score for each main action they take until the end of their next turn.
