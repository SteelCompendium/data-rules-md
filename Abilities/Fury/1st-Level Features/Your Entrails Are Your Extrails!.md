###### Your Entrails Are Your Extrails! (3 Ferocity)

*Hard for them to fight when they're busy holding in their giblets.*

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 3 + M damage; M < WEAK, bleeding (save ends)
- **12-16:** 5 + M damage; M < AVERAGE, bleeding (save ends)
