# Uncanny Dodge

When a damaging effect surrounds you, you stay two steps ahead.

|                       |                     |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Keywords:** Melee   | **Type:** Triggered |
| **Distance:** Reach 1 | **Target:** Self    |

- **Trigger:** You are targeted by a damaging area of effect.

**Effect:** You shift up to 2 squares. If that moves you out of the area of effect, you ignore the attack. Otherwise, you take half damage.

**Spend 1 Rage:** You move a willing adjacent ally affected by the attack with you, applying the same outcome to them.
