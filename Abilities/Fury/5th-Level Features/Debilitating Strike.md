###### Debilitating Strike (9 Ferocity)

*You need just one blow to sabotage your target.*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 10 + M damage; M < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 14 + M damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 20 + M damage; M < STRONG, slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** While slowed this way, the target takes 1 damage for every square they move, including from forced movement.
