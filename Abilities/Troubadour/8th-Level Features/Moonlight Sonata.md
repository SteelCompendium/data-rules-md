###### Moonlight Sonata

*Music pours out of your heart, filling the area with the utmost delicacy and without damper.*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who is dead can choose to continue taking turns after death. On each of their turns, a target can move and use either a main action or a maneuver, but can't spend Recoveries or use triggered actions At the end of the encounter, each target who chose to take turns this way turns to dust and blows away.
