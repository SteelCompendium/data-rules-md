###### Radical Fantasia

*𝅘𝅥𝅮♪Viras, my Viras, will you hold their hands as they cryyy-aaaiigh?♪*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that imposes forced movement gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement distance until the end of their turn. Additionally, once per combat round, each target can use a triggered action as a free triggered action.
