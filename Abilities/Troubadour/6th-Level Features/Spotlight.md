###### Spotlight

*The audience is watching, so you'd better give them a show.*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area gains 1 of their Heroic Resource. This Heroic Resource disappears at the end of the target's turn if they don't spend it.
