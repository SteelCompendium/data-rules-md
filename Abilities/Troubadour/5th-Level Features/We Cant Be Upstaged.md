###### We Can't Be Upstaged!

*Swordplay so graceful it looks like you all practiced this.*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, a target who starts their turn in the area gains a bonus to the distance they can shift equal to your Presence score until the end of their turn.
