###### "Fire Up the Night"

*Maybe you and I ♪ We can still bring the light!♪*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area doesn't take a bane on strikes against creatures with concealment. Once during their turn, they can search for hidden creatures as a free maneuver (see Hide and Sneak in Chapter 9: Tests).
