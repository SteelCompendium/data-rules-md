###### Extensive Rewrites (7 Drama)

*No, this isn't right. That foe was over there!*

| **Area, Magic** |                 **No action** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 4 burst**  | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** Slide 3; P < WEAK, this slide ignores the target's stability
- **12-16:** Slide 5; P < AVERAGE, this slide ignores the target's stability
- **17+:** Slide 7; P < STRONG, this slide ignores the target's stability

**Effect:** Instead of sliding a target, you can swap their location with another target as long as each can fit into the other's space. You can't slide targets into other creatures or objects using this ability.
