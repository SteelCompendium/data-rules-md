###### Acrobatics

*Folks love a good tumble.*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area can automatically obtain a tier 3 outcome on one test made to jump, tumble, or climb as part of their movement before the end of their turn.
