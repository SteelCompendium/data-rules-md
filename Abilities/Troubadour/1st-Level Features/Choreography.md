###### Choreography

*Taps, kicks, steps. It's all "choreography."*

| **Area, Magic, Performance** |                         **No action** |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------: |
| **📏 5 aura**                | **🎯 Self and each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the area gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of their turn.
