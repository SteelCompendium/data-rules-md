###### Harmonize (3 Drama)

*Give the chorus a little punch.*

| **Ranged**      |   **Triggered** |
| --------------- | --------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 5** | **🎯 One ally** |

**Trigger:** The target uses an ability that targets only one enemy and costs 3 or fewer of their Heroic Resource.

**Effect:** The target can choose one additional target for the triggering ability. Any damage dealt to the additional target is sonic damage.

**Spend 1+ Drama:** You can trigger this ability when a target uses an ability that has a Heroic Resource cost of 3 + each additional drama spent.
