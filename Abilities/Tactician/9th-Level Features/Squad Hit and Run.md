###### Squad! Hit and Run! (11 Focus)

*I had to pry this secret from the shadow colleges.*

| **Ranged**       |            **Main action** |
| ---------------- | -------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 Self and two allies** |

**Effect:** Each target gains 2 surges, and can use a free triggered action to use a signature ability that gains an edge. After resolving their ability, each target can shift up to 2 squares and become hidden even if they have no cover or concealment, or if they are observed.
