###### I'll Open and You'll Close (11 Focus)

*You create an opening for an ally.*

| **Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 5**        | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 6 + M damage
- **12-16:** 10 + M damage
- **17+:** 14 + M damage

**Effect:** One ally within 10 squares of you can use a heroic ability against the target as a free triggered action without spending any of their Heroic Resource, as long as they have enough Heroic Resource to pay for the ability. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina before the chosen ally has used their ability, the ally can pick a different target.
