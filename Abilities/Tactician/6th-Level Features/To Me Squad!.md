###### To Me Squad! (9 Focus)

*You lead your allies in a charge.*

| **Charge, Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main action** |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**                    | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 6\*\*+\*\* M damage; one ally within 10 squares can use the Charge main action as a free triggered action, and can use a melee strike signature ability instead of a free strike for the charge
- **12-16:** 9 + M damage; one ally within 10 squares can use the Charge main action as a free triggered action, and can use a melee strike signature ability that gains an edge instead of a free strike for the charge
- **17+:** 13\*\*+\*\* M damage; two allies within 10 squares can use the Charge main action as a free triggered action, and can each use a melee strike signature ability that gains an edge instead of a free strike for the charge

**Effect:** If the target is hit with two or more strikes as part of this ability and they have R < STRONG, they are dazed (save ends). If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina before one or both allies has made their strike, the ally or allies can pick a different target.
