###### Rout (7 Focus)

*The tide begins to turn.*

| **-**       | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **📏 Self** |  **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever you or any ally deals damage to a target marked by you who has R < AVERAGE, the target is frightened of the creature who dealt the damage (save ends).
