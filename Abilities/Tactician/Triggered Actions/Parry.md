# Parry

Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.

- **Trigger:** A creature makes a Weapon attack against the target.

**Effect:** The attack's damage against the target is halved.

**Spend 1 Focus:** The result of the attack's power roll is treated as one tier lower before the damage is halved. If the attack is a critical hit, the attacker can still take an additional action.
