###### Overwatch

*Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.*

| **Ranged**       |       **Triggered** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Trigger:** The target moves.

**Effect:** At any time during the target's movement, one ally can make a free strike against them.

**Spend 1 Focus:** If the target has R < AVERAGE, they are slowed (EoT).
