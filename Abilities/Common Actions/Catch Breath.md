# Catch Breath

By using the Catch Breath action, you spend a Recovery and [[Heal|heal]] an amount equal to your recovery value. In addition, you also gain the benefit of the [[Defend]] action.

If you are dying (see Dying and Death in Stamina), you can't take the Catch Breath action, but other creatures can help you spend recoveries.
