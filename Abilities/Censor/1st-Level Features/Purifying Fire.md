###### Purifying Fire (5 Wrath)

*The gods judge, fire cleanses.*

| **Magic, Melee, Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main Action** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1 or ranged 5**               | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 5 + M holy damage; M < WEAK, the target has fire weakness 3 (save ends)
- **12-16:** 9 + M holy damage; M < AVERAGE, the target has fire weakness 5 (save ends)
- **17+:** 12 + M holy damage; M < STRONG, the target has fire weakness 7 (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target has fire weakness from this ability, you can choose to have your abilities deal fire damage to the target instead of holy damage.
