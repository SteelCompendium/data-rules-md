###### Your Allies Turn on You! (11 Wrath)

*You turn your enemies' ire to the target.*

| **Ranged, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main Action** |
| -------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**           | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 5 + P damage; I < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 9 + P damage; I < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 12 + P damage; I < STRONG, slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target is slowed this way, each ally who starts their turn within 5 squares of them must use a free maneuver to make a free strike against the target. Additionally, while the target is slowed this way, each ally within 5 squares of them who can make a triggered free strike against a different creature must make the free strike against the target instead.
