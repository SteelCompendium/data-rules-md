###### Edict of Stillness (7 Wrath)

*The holy aura you project makes it painful for evil-doers to leave your reach.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a target moves or is force moved out of the area, they take holy damage equal to twice your Presence score. A target judged by you who moves willingly takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.
