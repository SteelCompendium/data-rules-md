###### Edict of Perfect Order (7 Wrath)

*Within the area of your divine presence, your enemies will regret using their fell abilities.*

| **Area, Magic** |                  **Maneuver** |
| --------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 2 aura**   | **🎯 Each enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter or until you are dying, whenever a target uses an ability that costs Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), they take holy damage equal to three times your Presence score. A target judged by you takes an extra 2d6 holy damage.
