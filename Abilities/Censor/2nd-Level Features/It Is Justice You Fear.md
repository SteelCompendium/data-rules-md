###### It Is Justice You Fear (5 Wrath)

*I am but a vessel. Your own deeds weigh upon you.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main Action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 8 + M holy damage; P < WEAK, frightened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 12 + M holy damage; P < AVERAGE, frightened (save ends)
- **17+:** 15 + M holy damage; P < STRONG, frightened (save ends)

**Effect:** If the target is already frightened of you or another creature and this ability would frighten them again, they instead take psychic damage equal to twice your Presence score.
