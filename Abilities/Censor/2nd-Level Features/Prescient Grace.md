###### Prescient Grace (5 Wrath)

*Gifted by a prescient vision, you warn an ally of an impending attack.*

| **Magic, Ranged** |           **Triggered** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**  | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Trigger:** An enemy within 10 squares starts their turn.

**Effect:** You can spend a Recovery to allow the target to regain Stamina equal to your recovery value. The target can then take their turn immediately before the triggering enemy.
