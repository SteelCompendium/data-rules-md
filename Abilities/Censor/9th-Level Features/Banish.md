###### Banish (11 Wrath)

*You sever the target's tenuous connection to the world.*

| **Melee, Strike, Weapon** |     **Main Action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Melee 1**            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Might:**

- **≤11:** 5 + M damage; P < WEAK, the target is banished (save ends)
- **12-16:** 8 + M damage; P < AVERAGE, the target is banished (save ends)
- **17+:** 11 + M damage; P < STRONG, the target is banished (save ends)

**Effect:** This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures not native to your current world. If you know the target's true name, this ability has a double edge. While banished, the target is sent to another manifold in the timescape and removed from the encounter map. A banished target can do nothing but make saving throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time they do so. If the target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to the timescape.
