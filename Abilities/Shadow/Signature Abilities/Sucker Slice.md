# Sucker Slice

Keeping an enemy's focus on you lets your ally hit hard.

| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Keywords:** Attack, Melee, Weapon | **Type:** Action       |
| **Distance:** Reach 1               | **Target:** 1 creature |

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- 11 or lower: 3 damage
- 12â€“16: 8 damage
- 17+: 12 damage

**Effect:** If you are flanking the target when you make this attack, one ally who is flanking with you has a double edge on melee attacks against the target until the end of the ally's next turn, even if they are no longer flanking the target.
