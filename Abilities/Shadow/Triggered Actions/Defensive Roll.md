# Defensive Roll

When an enemy attacks, you roll with the impact to reduce the harm.

| **Keywords:** —    | **Type:** Triggered |
| **Distance:** Self | **Target:** Self    |

- **Trigger:** Another creature damages you.

**Effect:** You shift up to 2 squares, halve the triggering damage, and don't suffer any effect associated with the damage. If you end this movement with concealment or cover, you can use the [[Hide]] maneuver even if you are observed.

**Spend 1 Insight:** If the triggering damage was from an attack, you also reduce the attack's damage by one tier.
