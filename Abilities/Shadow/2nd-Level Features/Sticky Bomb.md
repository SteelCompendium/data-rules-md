###### Sticky Bomb (5 Insight)

*Explosives are best when they're attached to an enemy.*

| **Ranged**       |     **Main action** |
| ---------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |

**Effect:** You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature, they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature otherwise notices the bomb and can disarm and remove it as a main action. If they don't, at the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. When the bomb detonates, you make a power roll targeting each enemy within 2 squares of it.

**Power Roll + Agility:**

- **≤11:** 4 + A fire damage
- **12-16:** 7 + A fire damage
- **17+:** 11 + A fire damage
