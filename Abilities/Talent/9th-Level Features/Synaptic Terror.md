###### Synaptic Terror (11 Clarity)

*You project a terrifying image into the brains of your foes, and their fear psionically invigorates your allies.*

| **Area, Psionic, Telepathy** |                        **Main action** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**               | **🎯 Each ally and enemy in the area** |

**Effect:** You and each target ally can't obtain lower than a tier 2 outcome on power rolls until the start of your next turn. Each target enemy is affected by the ability's power roll.

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** R < WEAK, frightened (save ends)
- **12-16:** R < AVERAGE, frightened (save ends)
- **17+:** R < STRONG, frightened (save ends)

**Strained:** You can't use this ability if doing so would cause you to have negative clarity.
