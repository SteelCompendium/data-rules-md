###### Resonant Mind Spike (11 Clarity)

*You fire a telepathic bolt empowered by every consciousness within reach directly into your foe's mind.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 15 + R psychic damage
- **12-16:** 24 + R psychic damage
- **17+:** 28 + R psychic damage

**Effect:** This ability ignores cover and concealment.

**Strained:** The ability roll scores a critical hit on a natural 17 or higher. You take half the damage the target takes, and you can't reduce this damage in any way.
