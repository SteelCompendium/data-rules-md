###### Gravitic Nova (11 Clarity)

*Unbridled psionic energy erupts from your body and flashes outward, hurling your foes back.*

| **Area, Psionic, Telekinesis** |                          **Main action** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**                 | **🎯 Each enemy and object in the area** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 6 damage; push 7
- **12-16:** 9 damage; push 10
- **17+:** 13 damage; push 15

**Effect:** On a critical hit, the size of the area increases by 3, and this ability deals an extra 10 damage.

**Strained:** You are weakened (save ends). If you scored a critical hit with this ability, you die.
