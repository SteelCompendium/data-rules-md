###### Borrow From the Future (11 Clarity)

*You lean on future heroism to assist you in the now.*

| **Area, Chronopathy, Psionic** |                 **Maneuver** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 2 burst**                 | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** The targets share 6 of their Heroic Resource among themselves, as you determine. A target can't gain more than 3 of their Heroic Resource this way. After using this ability, you can't gain any clarity until the end of the next combat round.
