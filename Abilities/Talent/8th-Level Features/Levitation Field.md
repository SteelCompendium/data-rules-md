###### Levitation Field

*You manipulate the air around your allies so they can move as freely through the sky as you can.*

| **Area, Psionic** |                 **Maneuver** |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------: |
| **📏 3 burst**    | **🎯 Each ally in the area** |

**Effect:** Each target can fly until the start of your next turn, and can immediately shift up to their speed. You can also shift up to your speed. While flying, a target's stability is reduced to 0 and can't be increased.

**Spend 5 Clarity:** The effects last for 1 hour instead.
