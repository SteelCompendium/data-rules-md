###### Rejuvenate (11 Clarity)

*You reshape the flow of time in the target's body to return it to an earlier state.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                 | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** Choose two of the following effects: - The target can spend any number of Recoveries. - The target gains 1 of their Heroic Resource, and can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn. - The target gains 2 surges, and gains a +3 bonus to speed until the end of the encounter.

**Strained:** You and the target both permanently grow visibly younger (the equivalent of 20 human years, to the minimum of an 18-yearold). Additionally, you are weakened and slowed (save ends).
