###### Soul Burn (7 Clarity)

*You blast their soul out of their body, leaving it to helplessly float back to a weakened husk.*

| **📏 Ranged 10**                            | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 6 + P damage; P < WEAK, dazed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 + P damage; P < AVERAGE, dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** 14 + P damage; P < STRONG, dazed (save ends)
