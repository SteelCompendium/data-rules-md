###### Fling Through Time (7 Clarity)

*You hurl the target through the annals of time, forcing them to witness every moment of their existence all at once.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |               **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                             | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 3 + P corruption damage; P < WEAK, weakened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 5 + P corruption damage; the target is flung through time, and if P < AVERAGER, they are weakened (save ends)
- **17+:** 8 + P corruption damage; the target is flung through time, and if P < STRONG, they are weakened (save ends)

**Effect:** A target who is flung through time is removed from the encounter map until the end of their next turn, reappearing in their original space or the nearest unoccupied space.

**Strained:** You take 2d6 damage and permanently grow visibly older (the equivalent of 10 years for a human). If you obtain a tier 3 outcome on the power roll, you gain 2 clarity.
