###### Hoarfrost

*You blast a foe with a pulse of cold energy.*

| **Cryokinesis, Psionic, Ranged**, **Strike** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                             | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Reason:**

- **≤11:** 2 + R cold damage; M < WEAK, slowed (EoT)
- **12-16:** 4 + R cold damage; M < AVERAGE, slowed (EoT)
- **17+:** 6 + R cold damage; M < STRONG, slowed (EoT)

**Strained:** You are slowed until the end of your next turn. Additionally, a target slowed by this ability is restrained instead.
