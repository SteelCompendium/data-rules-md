###### Inertia Soak (5 Clarity)

*Your psionic energy surrounds the target and pushes everything else away from them.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Telekinesis** |            **Maneuver** |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                 | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced movement until the start of your next turn. Whenever the target enters a square while under this effect, they can push one adjacent creature up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. When pushing an ally, the target can ignore that ally's stability. A creature can only be force moved this way once a turn.

**Strained:** You are weakened (save ends). While you are weakened this way, whenever you are force moved, the forced movement distance gains a +5 bonus.
