*You advance an enemy's age for a moment.*

| **Chronopathy, Psionic, Ranged, Strike** |               **Main action** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                         | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Power Roll + Presence:**

- **≤11:** 2 + P corruption damage; P < WEAK, slowed (save ends)
- **12-16:** 3 + P corruption damage; P < AVERAGE, slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 5 + P corruption damage; P < STRONG, slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** The target takes an extra 1 corruption damage for each additional time they are targeted by this ability during the encounter.

**Strained:** You gain 1 clarity when you obtain a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome on the power roll.
