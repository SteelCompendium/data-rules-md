###### Awe (3 Clarity)

*You project psionic energy out to a creature and take on a new visage in their mind.*

| **Psionic, Ranged, Strike, Telepathy** |     **Main action** |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                       | **🎯 One creature** |

**Effect:** If you target an ally, they gain temporary Stamina equal to three times your Presence score, and they can end one effect on them that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of their turn. If you target an enemy, you make a power roll.

- **≤11:** 3 + P psychic damage; I < WEAK, frightened (save ends)
- **12-16:** 6 + P psychic damage; I < AVERAGE, frightened (save ends)
- **17+:** 9 + P psychic damage; I < STRONG, frightened (save ends)
