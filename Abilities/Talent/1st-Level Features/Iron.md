###### Iron (5 Clarity)

*The target's skin turns to hard, dark metal, impenetrable and dense.*

| **Metamorphosis, Psionic, Ranged** |            **Maneuver** |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**                   | **🎯 Self or one ally** |

**Effect:** The target's stability increases by an amount equal to your Reason score, and they gain 10 temporary Stamina and 2 surges. This stability increase lasts until the target no longer has temporary Stamina from this ability.

**Strained:** You can't use maneuvers (save ends).
