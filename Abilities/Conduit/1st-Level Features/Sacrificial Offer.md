###### Sacrificial Offer

*Divine magic tears at your foe and defends a nearby friend.*

| **Magic, Ranged, Strike** |     **Main action** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------: |
| **📏 Ranged 10**          | **🎯 One creature** |

**Power Roll + Intuition:**

- **≤11:** 2 + I corruption damage
- **12-16:** 4 + I corruption damage
- **17+:** 6 + I corruption damage

**Effect:** Choose yourself or one ally within distance. That character can impose a bane on one power roll made against them before the end of their next turn.
